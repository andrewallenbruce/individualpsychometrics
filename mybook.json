  {"id":"ackermanIntelligenceProcessPersonality2018","abstract":"The intelligence-as-process, personality, interests, and intelligence-as-knowledge (PPIK) framework expands on the notions introduced by Cattell in his investment hypothesis. This framework enables to understand adult intellect in general, and to consider how the interactions among process-type intellectual abilities; non-ability traits, such as affective traits and conative traits; and an individual's investment of time and effort lead to the development and maintenance of domain knowledge in adulthood. The development of intelligence-as-knowledge in late adolescence and adulthood appears to be related to an individual's standing on a relatively small number of constellations of non-ability traits, called trait complexes. The introduction of an omnibus test of intelligence specifically designed for adults removes the problems caused by the concept of mental age and by reliance on tests that had been extended from assessment of children. In particular, for both young adults and middle-aged adults, scores on the science/math and intellectual/cultural trait complexes were positively associated with domain knowledge in academic domains, and the social trait complex was negatively correlated with knowledge across nearly all domains. The PPIK theory provides just one perspective on adult intelligence and adult intellectual development among many competing theories.

  {"id":"ahmedExecutiveFunctionAcademic2019","abstract":"Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (N = 1273) were analyzed to assess the longitudinal relations among executive function (EF) components in early childhood (54 months) and adolescence (15 years) and their prediction of academic achievement. We found that after controlling for early achievement, demographic, and home environment variables, only working memory at 54 months significantly predicted working memory at 15 years and that working memory was the only significant EF predictor of achievement at age 15. In contrast, all early achievement measures were significant predictors of later achievement. Furthermore, no demographic or home environment variables at 54 months significantly predicted EF at 15, and only maternal education significantly explained variance in adolescent math and literacy achievement. These findings demonstrate the predictability of working memory and highlight its importance for academic outcomes across development. However, the lack of associations of preschool inhibition and attention measures, after controlling for early achievement, demographic, and home environment variables, to corresponding measures in adolescence suggests the need for more developmentally sensitive measures of EF. Given that the EF measures used in this study are commonly used in educational and psychological research, more care should go into understanding the psychometric properties across development.

Contributions by leading experts examine multiple theoretical orientations and various identification approaches for dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and other common SLDs. Emphasizing real-world utility, this book provides important information for professionals who work with children and youth at risk; many of the SLD identification practices can be put to work immediately, and the expert coverage offers many strategies and interventions for student support in the classroom. This new second edition has been updated to align with the most current understanding of SLD manifestations, diagnostic assessment, and evidence-based interventions, and includes new material covering nonverbal learning disability, speech-language impairment, general learning difficulties, and differentially diagnosing SLD from other conditions. Early SLD identification and the right kind of help can raise the trajectory of a child's life. This book provides in-depth information to facilitate accurate identification and appropriate intervention to help you help the children in your care.  Understand how SLD manifests in academic performance Learn theory- and research-based approaches to SLD identification Examine the latest information about new aspects of SLD determination Utilize appropriate and effective intervention strategies for student support  If a child's learning disability is caught early, and the correct type of support is provided, that child gets the chance to develop the skills that lead to achievement in school and beyond. As a high-incidence disorder, SLD affects 10-15 percent of the general population, making successful identification an essential skill for those who work with children.

  {"id":"allorStudentsLexicalRetrieval2001","abstract":"Deficits in phonological processing are theorized to be responsible for at least some reading disabilities. A considerable amount of research demonstrates that many students can be taught one of these phonological processes—phonemic awareness. However, not all students have responded favorably to this instruction. Research has suggested that these nonresponders may be unable to retrieve phonological codes quickly from long-term memory. The purpose of this study was to examine whether such a deficiency, which we refer to as lexical retrieval weakness, blunts the effectiveness of combined phonemic awareness and decoding training. To this end, we compared the effectiveness of phonemic awareness and decoding training for students with and without severe lexical retrieval weaknesses. All students in both groups demonstrated poor phonemic awareness. The results suggested that students with relatively strong lexical retrieval skill responded more favorably to beginning reading instruction than did students with weak lexical retrieval skill. In other words, lexical retrieval weakness may influence reading development independently of the effects of phonemic awareness. Implications for instruction are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Allor","given":"Jill Howard"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Mathes","given":"Patricia G."}],"citation-key":"allorStudentsLexicalRetrieval2001","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/002221940103400306","ISSN":"0022-2194, 1538-4780","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,5]]},"language":"en","page":"264-275","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do students with and without lexical retrieval weaknesses respond differently to instruction?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/002221940103400306","volume":"34"},

However, there is less agreement about the relative contribution of general versus specific cognitive abilities to job performance. Similarly, it is not clear how cognitive abilities operate in the context of complex occupations. This study assessed the role of cognitive abilities on the performance of three aviation-related jobs: flying, navigation, and air battle management (ABM). Correlated-factor and bifactor models were used to draw a conclusion about the predictive relations between cognitive abilities and job performance. Overall, the importance of particular cognitive abilities tends to vary across the three occupations, and each occupation has different sets of essential abilities.

Studies were selected in which (a) children ranged from preschoolers to third graders and were at risk for reading disabilities, (b) treatments targeted early literacy, (c) outcomes reflected reading development, and (d) students' unresponsiveness to intervention was described. The literature review included a computer search of several databases, an ancestral search of relevant articles and books, and a manual search of 11 journals. Twenty-three studies were identified, 8 of which were designed primarily to identify characteristics of unresponsive students; the remaining 15 studies focused on treatment effectiveness but also identified and described unresponsive students. A majority of unresponsive students had phonological awareness deficits. Additional characteristics included phonological retrieval or encoding deficits, low verbal ability, behavior problems, and developmental delays. Finally, methodological issues are discussed that complicate comparisons of nonresponders across studies, and implications for future research are described.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Al Otaiba","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Douglas"}],"citation-key":"alotaibaCharacteristicsChildrenWho2002","container-title":"Remedial and Special Education","container-title-short":"Remedial and Special Education","DOI":"10.1177/07419325020230050501","ISSN":"0741-9325, 1538-4756","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,9]]},"language":"en","page":"300-316","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Characteristics of children who are unresponsive to early literacy intervention: a review of the literature","title-short":"Characteristics of children who are unresponsive to early literacy intervention","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07419325020230050501","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"alotaibaWhoAreYoung2006","abstract":"The primary purpose of this study was to identify student characteristics that reliably predict responsiveness and nonresponsiveness to generally effective early literacy interventions. Participants were 104 children, including 7 with special needs and Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), who were tested in kindergarten and first grade. Responsiveness/nonresponsiveness status was determined after 2 years during which children participated in best practice instruction (a) in kindergarten and first grade, (b) in kindergarten only, (c) in first grade only, or (d) in neither year. This facilitated the study of three groups. Always responsive students met responsiveness criteria in both years. Sometimes responsive students met the criteria in only one year. Nonresponsive students did not meet the criteria in either year. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis indicated that the three groups were reliably different from one another on measures of problem behavior, verbal memory, sentence imitation, syntactic awareness, vocabulary, naming speed, and segmentation. A combination of naming speed, vocabulary, sentence imitation, problem behavior, and amount of intervention correctly predicted 82.1% of nonresponsive students, 30.0% of sometimes responsive students, and 84.1% of always responsive students. Fifty students from kindergarten and first grade were tested again at the end of what should have been their third-grade year. All but 1 of the nonresponsive students who received intervention had been identified as requiring special education and had an IEP with reading goals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Al Otaiba","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Douglas"}],"citation-key":"alotaibaWhoAreYoung2006","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/00222194060390050401","ISSN":"0022-2194, 1538-4780","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,9]]},"language":"en","page":"414-431","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Who are the young children for whom best practices in reading are ineffective?: An experimental and longitudinal study","title-short":"Who are the young children for whom best practices in reading are ineffective?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222194060390050401","volume":"39"},

The experimental sample included 118 3rd to 5th grade children learning Italian, a language with a highly regular orthography. We adopted a flexible method of analysis, i.e., the Network Analysis (NA), particularly suited for exploring relations among different domains and where the direct relations between a set of intercorrelated variables is the main interest. Results indicated an independent and unique contribution of syntactic comprehension skills as well as reading fluency and reading accuracy in the comprehension of a written text. The decoding measures were not directly associated with non-verbal reasoning and the latter was not directly associated with reading comprehension but was strongly related to oral syntactic comprehension. Overall, the pattern of findings is broadly consistent with the predictions of SVR and underscores how, in an orthographically regular language, reading fluency and reading accuracy as well as oral comprehension skills directly influence reading comprehension. Data are discussed in a cross-linguistic perspective. Implications for education and rehabilitation are also presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Angelelli","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Romano","given":"Daniele Luigi"},{"family":"Marinelli","given":"Chiara Valeria"},{"family":"Macchitella","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Zoccolotti","given":"Pierluigi"}],"citation-key":"angelelliSimpleViewReading2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Although previous research has supported the more-is-better hypothesis by documenting linearity of ability-performance relationships, such research has not been sensitive enough to detect deviations at the top ends of the score distributions. An alternative position receiving considerable attention is the good-enough hypothesis, which suggests that although higher levels of ability may result in better performance up to a threshold, above this threshold greater ability does not translate to better performance. In this study, the nature of the relationship between cognitive ability and performance was examined throughout the score range in four large-scale data sets.

  {"id":"beaujeanMisuseIQScores2018","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to describe the origins of patterns of strengths and weaknesses (PSW) methods for identifying specific learning disabilities (SLD) and to provide a comprehensive review of the assumptions and evidence supporting the most commonly-used PSW method in the United States: Dual Discrepancy/Consistency (DD/C). Given their use in determining whether students have access to special education and related services, it is important that any method used to identify SLD have supporting evidence. A review of the DD/C evidence indicates it cannot currently be classified as an evidence-based method for identifying individuals with a SLD. We show that the DD/C method is unsound for three major reasons: (a) it requires test scores have properties that they fundamentally lack, (b) lack of experimental utility evidence supporting its use, and (c) evidence supporting the inability of the method to identify SLD accurately.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Beaujean","given":"A.

  {"id":"bergeronStatesEligibilityGuidelines2008","abstract":"Mental retardation (MR) has traditionally been defined as a disorder in intellectual and adaptive functioning beginning in the developmental period. Guided by a federal definition of MR described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, it is the responsibility of each of the United States to describe eligibility guidelines for special education services. The purpose of this study was to examine eligibility guidelines for MR for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This study examined the terms used to describe MR, the use of classification levels, the cutoff scores, and the adaptive behavior considerations for each state. In addition, this study examined guidelines for consideration of intelligence test part scores and consideration of the unreliability of IQs through consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) or an IQ range. As found in previous studies, results revealed great variation in the specific eligibility guidelines for MR from state to state. The greatest variation appeared to be across the adaptive behavior considerations. Approximately 20% of states (10) recommend consideration of intelligence test part scores, and approximately 39% of states (20) recommend attention to unreliability of IQs through consideration of the SEM or an IQ range.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergeron","given":"Renee"},{"family":"Floyd","given":"Randy G."},{"family":"Shands","given":"Elizabeth I."}],"citation-key":"bergeronStatesEligibilityGuidelines2008","container-title":"Education and Training in Developmental Disabilities","ISSN":"1547-0350","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"123-131","publisher":"Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities","source":"JSTOR","title":"States' eligibility guidelines for mental retardation: An update and consideration of part scores and unreliability of IQs","title-short":"States' eligibility guidelines for mental retardation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23879749","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"berkowitzWhichCognitiveAbilities2018","abstract":"Previous research has shown that psychometrically assessed cognitive abilities are predictive of achievements in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) even in highly selected samples. Spatial ability, in particular, has been found to be crucial for success in STEM, though its role relative to other abilities has been shown mostly when assessed years before entering higher STEM education. Furthermore, the role of spatial ability for mathematics in higher STEM education has been markedly understudied, although math is central across STEM domains. We investigated whether ability differences among students who entered higher STEM education were predictive of achievements during the first undergraduate year. We assessed 317 undergraduate students in Switzerland (150 from mechanical engineering and 167 from math-physics) on multiple measures of spatial, verbal and numerical abilities. In a structural equation model, we estimated the effects of latent ability factors on students’ achievements on a range of first year courses. Although ability-test scores were mostly at the upper scale range, differential effects on achievements were found: spatial ability accounted for achievements in an engineering design course beyond numerical, verbal and general reasoning abilities, but not for math and physics achievements. Math and physics achievements were best predicted by numerical, verbal and general reasoning abilities. Broadly, the results provide evidence for the predictive power of individual differences in cognitive abilities even within highly competent groups. More specifically, the results suggest that spatial ability’s role in advanced STEM learning, at least in math-intensive subjects, is less critical than numerical and verbal reasoning abilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Berkowitz","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Elsbeth"}],"citation-key":"berkowitzWhichCognitiveAbilities2018","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"bobkoUsefulnessUnitWeights2007","abstract":"Combining/weighting subscores into an aggregate score involves issues that apply to many fields in the organizational sciences (e.g., weighting predictors in selection, weighting multiple performance appraisal indicators, overall evaluation of organizations). The weights that are used in practice can be different (differential weights) or equal (unit weights). Relevant literature across multiple disciplines and multiple decades is reviewed. The literature indicates that unit weights have substantial predictive validity when compared with regression weights, but there is a lack of data on how other differential weighting strategies (e.g., weights generated by subject matter experts) compare to unit weights. In response, a primary and a meta-analytic study are provided here. The recent literature also contains some potential criticisms of unit weights in regard to personnel selection and content validation—and those statements are evaluated. The data and findings indicate that unit weights can be a highly appropriate approach for weighting under many circumstances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bobko","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Roth","given":"Philip L."},{"family":"Buster","given":"Maury A."}],"citation-key":"bobkoUsefulnessUnitWeights2007","container-title":"Organizational Research Methods","container-title-short":"Organizational Research Methods","DOI":"10.1177/1094428106294734","ISSN":"1094-4281, 1552-7425","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10]]},"language":"en","page":"689-709","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The usefulness of unit weights in creating composite scores: A literature review, application to content validity, and meta-analysis","title-short":"The usefulness of unit weights in creating composite scores","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1094428106294734","volume":"10"},

Two ways cognitive batteries could inform intervention are identified: a disordinal (i.e., aptitude-treatment interaction) model and an ordinal (i.e., g) model. Existing research provides little support for disordinal models and modest to strong support for ordinal models when applied to conditions of incomplete instruction. Limitations to what can be known (e.g., a failure to prove is not proof of failure) are identified to avoid holding intervention validity research to inappropriate evidential standards. Finally, issues that are within the realm of knowledge but for which there is currently insufficient or no evidence are identified as logical next steps toward understanding the intervention validity of cognitive assessment batteries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Braden","given":"Jeffery P."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Steven R."}],"citation-key":"bradenInterventionValidityCognitive2009","container-title":"Assessment for Effective Intervention","container-title-short":"Assessment for Effective Intervention","DOI":"10.1177/1534508407313013","ISSN":"1534-5084, 1938-7458","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"language":"en","page":"106-115","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intervention validity of cognitive assessment: Knowns, unknowables, and unknowns","title-short":"Intervention validity of cognitive assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1534508407313013","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"breitSpearmanLawDiminishing2019","abstract":"This chapter presents the phenomenon known as \"Spearman's law of diminishing returns\" (SLODR). SLODR belongs to the broader research field studying ability differentiation where variances of general and/or specific abilities vary with age or the level of general cognitive ability. Specifically, SLODR implies that the strength with which general intelligence (as represented by the general factor g) affects manifest test scores decreases for individuals with increasing levels of g, while the factor structure of intelligence is the same for all individuals across the whole ability range. Thus, in individuals with low cognitive ability, the g-factor is the main source of (reliable, observed) mental test variance. In individuals with high cognitive ability, however, its impact is reduced, increasing the relative importance of other, more specific cognitive abilities to explain mental test variance. The chapter discusses theoretical implications of this phenomenon for theories of general intelligence. It demonstrates practical implications regarding the ability dependent use and interpretation of intelligence tests by the results of two recent studies.

  {"id":"brinchSchoolingAdolescenceRaises2012","abstract":"Although some scholars maintain that education has little effect on intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, others claim that IQ scores are indeed malleable, primarily through intervention in early childhood. The causal effect of education on IQ at later ages is often difficult to uncover because analyses based on observational data are plagued by problems of reverse causation and self-selection into further education. We exploit a reform that increased compulsory schooling from 7 to 9 y in Norway in the 1960s to estimate the effect of education on IQ. We find that this schooling reform, which primarily affected education in the middle teenage years, had a substantial effect on IQ scores measured at the age of 19 y.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Brinch","given":"Christian N."},{"family":"Galloway","given":"Taryn Ann"}],"citation-key":"brinchSchoolingAdolescenceRaises2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"brownCanYouEver2021","abstract":"Despite a long-standing expert consensus about the importance of cognitive ability for life outcomes, contrary views continue to proliferate in scholarly and popular literature. This divergence of beliefs presents an obstacle for evidence-based policymaking and decision-making in a variety of settings. One commonly held idea is that greater cognitive ability does not matter or is actually harmful beyond a certain point (sometimes stated as > 100 or 120 IQ points). We empirically tested these notions using data from four longitudinal, representative cohort studies comprising 48,558 participants in the United States and United Kingdom from 1957 to the present. We found that ability measured in youth has a positive association with most occupational, educational, health, and social outcomes later in life. Most effects were characterized by a moderate to strong linear trend or a practically null effect (mean R\n              2\n              range = .002–.256). Nearly all nonlinear effects were practically insignificant in magnitude (mean incremental R\n              2\n              = .001) or were not replicated across cohorts or survey waves. We found no support for any downside to higher ability and no evidence for a threshold beyond which greater scores cease to be beneficial. Thus, greater cognitive ability is generally advantageous—and virtually never detrimental.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Matt I."},{"family":"Wai","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Chabris","given":"Christopher F."}],"citation-key":"brownCanYouEver2021","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691620964122","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,8]]},"language":"en","page":"174569162096412","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Can you ever be too smart for your own good?

Previous studies examined the invariance of the WJ assessments across sex and age groups using factor analytic methods. Psychometric network modeling is an alternative methodology that can address both direct and indirect relationships among the observed variables. In this study, we employed psychometric network modeling to examine the invariance of the WJ IV COG across sex and age groups. Using a normative sample (n = 4212 participants) representative of the United States population, we tested the extent to which the factorial structure of the WJ IV COG aligned with CHC theory for the school-aged sample. Next, we used psychometric network modeling as a data-driven method to investigate whether the network structure of the WJ IV COG remains similar across different sex and age (age 6 to 19, inclusively) groups. Our results showed that the WJ IV COG maintained the same network structure across all age and sex groups, although the network structure at younger ages indicated weaker relationships among some subtests. Overall, the results provide construct validity evidence for the WJ IV COG, based on both theoretical and data-driven methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bulut","given":"Okan"},{"family":"Cormier","given":"Damien C."},{"family":"Aquilina","given":"Alexandra M."},{"family":"Bulut","given":"Hatice C."}],"citation-key":"bulutAgeSexInvariance2021","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"burgoyneIncrementalValidityPlacekeeping2021","abstract":"Multitasking is ubiquitous in everyday life, which means there is value in developing measures that predict successful multitasking performance. In a large sample (N = 404 contributing data), we examined the predictive and incremental validity of placekeeping, which is the ability to perform a sequence of operations in a certain order without omissions or repetitions. In the context of multitasking, placekeeping should play a role in the performance of procedural subtasks and the interleaving of subtasks that interrupt each other. Regression analyses revealed that placekeeping ability accounted for 11% of the variance in multitasking performance, and had incremental validity relative to each of a diverse set of cognitive abilities (working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, perceptual speed, and crystallized intelligence). The predictive validity of placekeeping for multitasking was stable across samples of performance and robust to placekeeping practice. Broader measures of performance on our placekeeping task accounted for 21% of the variance in multitasking performance and had incremental validity relative to an estimate of psychometric g. The results provide evidence that placekeeping is a distinct cognitive ability with its own specific role to play in multitasking, and raise the possibility that measures of placekeeping ability could have utility in selecting personnel for occupations that require certain kinds of multitasking, such as interleaving of procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgoyne","given":"Alexander P."},{"family":"Hambrick","given":"David Z."},{"family":"Altmann","given":"Erik M."}],"citation-key":"burgoyneIncrementalValidityPlacekeeping2021","container-title":"Psychological Research","container-title-short":"Psychological Research","DOI":"10.1007/s00426-020-01348-7","ISSN":"1430-2772","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1515-1528","source":"Springer Link","title":"Incremental validity of placekeeping as a predictor of multitasking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-020-01348-7","volume":"85"},
  {"id":"burgoynePlacekeepingAbilityComponent2019","abstract":"The question of what cognitive processes contribute to fluid intelligence (Gf)—the ability to solve novel problems—continues to be central in intelligence research. Here, we considered the contribution of placekeeping, which is the ability to perform a sequence of steps in a prescribed order without omissions or repetitions. Placekeeping plays a role in problem solving but also rests on the ability to remember past performance, so it may simply reduce to working memory capacity (WMC). To investigate this possibility, we evaluated whether placekeeping accounts for individual differences in Gf above and beyond WMC. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that placekeeping ability accounted for 12% of the variance in Gf above and beyond WMC. By contrast, WMC accounted for only 2% of the variance in Gf above and beyond placekeeping ability. Structural equation modeling revealed that placekeeping ability and WMC are distinct at the latent variable level, and together they accounted for 77% of the variance in Gf. However, whereas placekeeping ability significantly predicted Gf in the structural equation model, WMC did not. In general, the results suggest that placekeeping ability is distinct from WMC and contributes substantially to individual differences in Gf.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgoyne","given":"Alexander P."},{"family":"Hambrick","given":"David Z."},{"family":"Altmann","given":"Erik M."}],"citation-key":"burgoynePlacekeepingAbilityComponent2019","container-title":"The American Journal of Psychology","DOI":"10.5406/amerjpsyc.132.4.0439","ISSN":"0002-9556","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"439-449","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Placekeeping ability as a component of fluid intelligence: Not just working memory capacity","title-short":"Placekeeping ability as a component of fluid intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjpsyc.132.4.0439","volume":"132"},

They examine the evidence for Matthew effects in reading and vocabulary between ages 8 and 11 in groups of children identified with good and poor reading comprehension at 8 years. They also investigate evidence for Matthew effects in reading and vocabulary between 8 and 16 years, in the larger sample. The poor comprehenders showed reduced growth in vocabulary compared to the good comprehenders, but not in word reading or reading comprehension ability. They also obtained lower scores on measures of out-of-school literacy. Analyses of the whole sample revealed that initial levels of reading experience and reading comprehension predicted vocabulary at ages 11, 14, and 16 after controlling for general ability and vocabulary skills when aged 8. The authors discuss these findings in relation to the influence of reading on vocabulary development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Cain","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Oakhill","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"cainMatthewEffectsYoung2011","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/0022219411410042","ISSN":"0022-2194, 1538-4780","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9]]},"language":"en","page":"431-443","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Matthew effects in young readers: reading comprehension and reading experience aid vocabulary development","title-short":"Matthew effects in young readers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022219411410042","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"caitoDevelopmentalNeurotoxicityLead2017","abstract":"Lead exposure is a major concern for the developing nervous system. Environmental exposures to lead, predominantly from contaminated water or lead paint chips, account for the majority of exposures to children. In utero and early life exposures to lead have been associated with lower IQ, antisocial and delinquent behaviors, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In this review, we will discuss sources of developmental lead exposure and mechanisms of lead neurotoxicity. We will highlight both human epidemiological studies showing associations between lead exposure and behavioral abnormalities as well as experimental data from animal studies. Finally, we will discuss the effects of lead on neurological endpoint past childhood, namely, development of Alzheimer's disease in old age.","author":[{"family":"Caito","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Aschner","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"caitoDevelopmentalNeurotoxicityLead2017","container-title":"Neurotoxicity of metals","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-60189-2_1","editor":[{"family":"Aschner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Lucio G."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-60189-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"3–12","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","title":"Developmental neurotoxicity of lead","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60189-2_1"},

  {"id":"cartwrightContributionsExecutiveFunction2020","abstract":"Reading comprehension is an incredibly complex, purposeful activity that involves simultaneous orchestration and integration of multiple processes. However, dominant perspectives suggest that two clusters of skills, word reading and language comprehension, account for successful reading. Such two-factor models are problematic because they do not easily account for complexities in reading comprehension processes or for contributions to reading comprehension of other individual difference variables related to the purposeful nature of reading, such as executive functions (EFs) and intrinsic motivation. Further, simple models may lead to oversimplification of research questions, curricula, and instructional practices, causing researchers and educators to miss important contributors to reading comprehension necessary for students to develop into skilled readers. In this study, the authors assessed the unique contributions of EFs, both domain-general and reading-specific, and cognitive intrinsic motivation (i.e., the desire to engage in effortful cognitive activities) to reading comprehension in 122 university students beyond language comprehension and word-reading skills. Findings confirm unique contributions of cognitive intrinsic motivation and reading-specific EF to students’ reading comprehension beyond established predictors and domain-general EFs. Findings also suggest complexities, such as impacts of language comprehension on word reading, as well as impacts of cognitive intrinsic motivation on both language and reading comprehension, that should be considered in theory and practice. Finally, because reading-specific EF contributed to reading comprehension directly and indirectly beyond controls, these findings underscore the importance of applying knowledge of EF to specific reading processes to better support students who struggle to understand text.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Kelly B."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sherman A."},{"family":"Barber","given":"Ana Taboada"},{"family":"DeWyngaert","given":"Laura U."},{"family":"Lane","given":"Amanda B."},{"family":"Singleton","given":"Terrain"}],"citation-key":"cartwrightContributionsExecutiveFunction2020","container-title":"Reading Research Quarterly","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rrq.273","ISSN":"1936-2722","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 International Literacy Association","note":"ZSCC: 0000004","page":"345-369","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Contributions of executive function and cognitive intrinsic motivation to university students’ reading comprehension","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ila.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rrq.273","volume":"55"},
  {"id":"cartwrightFartransferEffectsExecutive2020","abstract":"This study assessed the impact of a teacher-delivered, small-group reading-specific executive function (EF) intervention on reading performance in a sample of 57 teacher-identified struggling readers, ranging in age from 7;6 to 12;3 (Mage = 9;10) in 2nd to 5th grades at a public elementary school in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Near-transfer effects of EF interventions are more common than far-transfer to academic skills. Thus, we assessed near- and far-transfer effects for intervention (n = 29) and control (n = 28) children. The reading-specific EF intervention produced medium to large effects on reading-specific and domain-general EF skills as well as on researcher-administered and school-administered reading comprehension measures, even after grade level (and thus reading teacher), verbal ability, children’s age, and respective pretest scores were controlled. These findings underscore the importance of translational work that takes researcher-tested interventions into real-world contexts to support children’s development. Implications of findings for practice are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Kelly B."},{"family":"Bock","given":"Allison M."},{"family":"Clause","given":"Janelle H."},{"family":"Coppage August","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Heather G."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Kenneth J."}],"citation-key":"cartwrightFartransferEffectsExecutive2020","container-title":"Cognitive Development","container-title-short":"Cognitive Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.cogdev.2020.100932","ISSN":"0885-2014","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100932","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Near- and far-transfer effects of an executive function intervention for 2nd to 5th-grade struggling readers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201420300861","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"comptonCognitiveAcademicProfiles2012","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the cognitive and academic profiles associated with learning disability (LD) in reading comprehension, word reading, applied problems, and calculations. The goal was to assess the specificity hypothesis, in which unexpected underachievement associated with LD is represented in terms of distinctive patterns of cognitive and academic strengths and weaknesses. At the start of 3rd grade, the authors assessed 684 students on five cognitive dimensions (nonverbal problem solving, processing speed, concept formation, language, and working memory), and across Grades 3 through 5, the authors assessed performance in each academic area three to four times.

  {"id":"conwayIndividualDifferencesAttention2021","abstract":"Process overlap theory (POT) is a new theoretical framework designed to account for the general factor of intelligence (g). According to POT, g does not reflect a general cognitive ability. Instead, g is the result of multiple domain-general executive attention processes and multiple domain-specific processes that are sampled in an overlapping manner across a battery of intelligence tests. POT explains several benchmark findings on human intelligence. However, the precise nature of the executive attention processes underlying g remains unclear. In the current paper, we discuss challenges associated with building a theory of individual differences in attention and intelligence. We argue that the conflation of psychological theories and statistical models, as well as problematic inferences based on latent variables, impedes research progress and prevents theory building. Two studies designed to illustrate the unique features of POT relative to previous approaches are presented. In Study 1, a simulation is presented to illustrate precisely how POT accounts for the relationship between executive attention processes and g. In Study 2, three datasets from previous studies are reanalyzed (N = 243, N = 234, N = 945) and reveal a discrepancy between the POT simulated model and the unity/diversity model of executive function. We suggest that this discrepancy is largely due to methodological problems in previous studies but also reflects different goals of research on individual differences in attention. The unity/diversity model is designed to facilitate research on executive function and dysfunction associated with cognitive and neural development and disease. POT is uniquely suited to guide and facilitate research on individual differences in cognitive ability and the investigation of executive attention processes underlying g.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Conway","given":"Andrew R.

  {"id":"cookOpenScienceSinglecase2022","abstract":"Research indicating many study results do not replicate has raised questions about the credibility of science and prompted concerns about a potential reproducibility crisis. Moreover, most published research is not freely accessible, which limits the potential impact of science. Open science, which aims to make the research process more open and reproducible, has been proposed as one approach to increase the credibility and impact of scientific research. Although relatively little attention has been paid to open science in relation to single-case design, we propose that open-science practices can be applied to enhance the credibility and impact of single-case design research. In this article, we discuss how open-science practices align with other recent developments in single-case design research, describe four prominent open-science practices (i.e., preregistration, registered reports, data and materials sharing, and open access), and discuss potential benefits and limitations of each practice for single-case design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Bryan G."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Austin H."},{"family":"Maggin","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Therrien","given":"William J."},{"family":"Barton","given":"Erin E."},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"John Wills"},{"family":"Reichow","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Talbott","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."}],"citation-key":"cookOpenScienceSinglecase2022","container-title":"Remedial and Special Education","container-title-short":"Remedial and Special Education","DOI":"10.1177/0741932521996452","ISSN":"0741-9325, 1538-4756","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10]]},"language":"en","page":"359-369","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Open science and single-case design research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0741932521996452","volume":"43"},

Findings indicate that some cognitive abilities were stronger predictors of reading achievement than previously found (e.g., Gf, Ga, and Gs). Most notably, the Woodcock-Johnson–IV Gf cluster was found to be the strongest and most consistent predictor of reading achievement.

  {"id":"cowanManyFacesWorking2017","abstract":"The topic of working memory (WM) is ubiquitous in research on cognitive psychology and on individual differences. According to one definition, it is a small amount of information kept in a temporary state of heightened accessibility; it is used in most types of communication and problem solving. Short-term storage has been defined as the passive (i.e., non-attention-based, nonstrategic) component of WM or, alternatively, as a passive store separate from an attention-based WM. Here I note that much confusion has been created by the use by various investigators of many, subtly different definitions of WM and short-term storage. The definitions are sometimes made explicit and sometimes implied. As I explain, the different definitions may have stemmed from the use of a wide variety of techniques to explore WM, along with differences in theoretical orientation. By delineating nine previously used definitions of WM and explaining how additional ones may emerge from combinations of these nine, I hope to improve scientific discourse on WM. The potential advantages of clarity about definitions of WM and short-term storage are illustrated with respect to several ongoing research controversies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Cowan","given":"Nelson"}],"citation-key":"cowanManyFacesWorking2017","container-title":"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review","container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-016-1191-6","ISSN":"1531-5320","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC: 0000265","page":"1158-1170","source":"Springer Link","title":"The many faces of working memory and short-term storage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1191-6","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"craddockRethinkingPsychosisDisadvantages2007","abstract":"Emil Kraepelin would clearly recognize his 19th century dichotomy within current operational classifications of psychosis. However, he might be surprised at its survival, given the extent to which it has been undermined by the weight of currently available empirical evidence. The failure of this evidence to influence diagnostic practice reflects not only the comfortable simplicity of the dichotomous approach, but also the fact that this approach has for many years continued to receive support from some areas of research, particularly genetic epidemiology. This, however, is changing and findings from genetic epidemiology are being reappraised. More importantly, the potential of molecular genetics to indicate biological systems involved in psychopathology has been recognized, and with it the potential to develop diagnostic classifications that have greater biological validity. Crucially, this will facilitate diagnostic schemes with much greater clinical utility, allowing clinicians to select treatments based on underlying pathogenesis. Recent molecular genetic findings have demonstrated very clearly the inadequacies of the dichotomous view, and highlighted the importance of better classifying cases with both psychotic and affective symptoms. In this article we discuss these issues and suggest ways forward, both immediately and for DSM-V and ICD-11. If psychiatry is to translate the opportunities offered by new research methodologies, we must move to a classificatory approach that is worthy of the 21st century.","author":[{"family":"Craddock","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Owen","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"craddockRethinkingPsychosisDisadvantages2007","container-title":"World psychiatry: official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)","container-title-short":"World Psychiatry","ISSN":"1723-8617","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"84-91","PMCID":"PMC2219899","PMID":"18235858","source":"PubMed","title":"Rethinking psychosis: the disadvantages of a dichotomous classification now outweigh the advantages","title-short":"Rethinking psychosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

In this study we investigated the extent to which executive function skills contribute to these three components of mathematical knowledge, whether this mediates the relationship between executive functions and overall mathematics achievement, and if these relationships change with age. Two hundred and ninety-three participants aged between 8 and 25years completed a large battery of mathematics and executive function tests. Domain-specific skills partially mediated the relationship between executive functions and mathematics achievement: Inhibitory control within the numerical domain was associated with factual knowledge and procedural skill, which in turn was associated with mathematical achievement. Working memory contributed to mathematics achievement indirectly through factual knowledge, procedural skill and, to a lesser extent, conceptual understanding. There remained a substantial direct pathway between working memory and mathematics achievement however, which may reflect the role of working memory in identifying and constructing problem representations. These relationships were remarkably stable from 8years through to young adulthood. Our findings help to refine existing multi-component frameworks of mathematics and understand the mechanisms by which executive functions support mathematics achievement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Cragg","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Keeble","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Roome","given":"Hannah E."},{"family":"Gilmore","given":"Camilla"}],"citation-key":"craggDirectIndirectInfluences2017","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2017.01.014","ISSN":"0010-0277","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,1]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC: 0000121","page":"12-26","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Direct and indirect influences of executive functions on mathematics achievement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717300239","volume":"162"},

  {"id":"dearyIntelligence2012","abstract":"Individual differences in human intelligence are of interest to a wide range of psychologists and to many people outside the discipline. This overview of contributions to intelligence research covers the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is a survey of some of the major books that appeared since 2000, at different levels of expertise and from different points of view. Contributions to the phenotype of intelligence differences are discussed, as well as some contributions to causes and consequences of intelligence differences. The major causal issues covered concern the environment and genetics, and how intelligence differences are being mapped to brain differences. The major outcomes discussed are health, education, and socioeconomic status. Aging and intelligence are discussed, as are sex differences in intelligence and whether twins and singletons differ in intelligence. More generally, the degree to which intelligence has become a part of broader research in neuroscience, health, and social science is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Deary","given":"Ian J."}],"citation-key":"dearyIntelligence2012","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","container-title-short":"Annu.

A further evaluation is provided by an empirical evaluation that compares statistical estimates using different approaches in a large sample of children (ages 9–13 years, N = 780) administered a comprehensive battery of cognitive measures. Results from this study demonstrate the ramifications of using the bifactor and Schmid–Leiman (BF/SL) technique and suggest that using BF/SL methods limit interpretation of cognitive abilities to only a general factor. The inadvertent use of BF/SL methods is demonstrated to impact both model dimensionality and variance estimates for specific measures. As demonstrated in this study, conclusions from both exploratory and confirmatory studies using BF/SL methods are significantly questioned, especially for studies with a questionable theoretical basis. Guidelines for the interpretation of cognitive test scores in applied practice are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Decker","given":"Scott L."},{"family":"Bridges","given":"Rachel M."},{"family":"Luedke","given":"Jessica C."},{"family":"Eason","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"deckerDimensionalEvaluationCognitive2021","container-title":"Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment","container-title-short":"Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment","DOI":"10.1177/0734282920940879","ISSN":"0734-2829, 1557-5144","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","page":"3-27","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dimensional evaluation of cognitive measures: Methodological confounds and theoretical concerns","title-short":"Dimensional evaluation of cognitive measures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0734282920940879","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"deneysLogicFastSlow2019","abstract":"Studies on human reasoning have long established that intuitions can bias inference and lead to violations of logical norms. Popular dual-process models, which characterize thinking as an interaction between intuitive (System 1) and deliberate (System 2) thought processes, have presented an appealing explanation for this observation. According to this account, logical reasoning is traditionally considered as a prototypical example of a task that requires effortful deliberate thinking. In recent years, however, a number of findings obtained with new experimental paradigms have brought into question the traditional dual-process characterization. A key observation is that people can process logical principles in classic reasoning tasks intuitively and without deliberation. We review the paradigms and sketch how this work is leading to the development of revised dual-process models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"De Neys","given":"Wim"},{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"}],"citation-key":"deneysLogicFastSlow2019","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721419855658","ISSN":"0963-7214, 1467-8721","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"503-509","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Logic, fast and slow: Advances in dual-process theorizing","title-short":"Logic, fast and slow","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721419855658","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"doleanLanguageSkillsNot2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The simple view of reading proposes that the development of reading comprehension in early elementary school is best predicted by children’s fluent decoding and oral language skills. Recent studies challenge this view and suggest that executive functions should also be included in this theoretical model; however, the empirical evidence is not strong enough to clearly support or refute this hypothesis. In this short-term longitudinal study, we used latent variables to test whether executive functions have direct effects on the development of reading comprehension in 184 Romanian second graders, beyond fluent decoding and oral language skills. The results indicated that the initial stages of reading comprehension were associated with executive functions, but only the language skills could independently predict the development of reading comprehension. Our findings show that executive functions do not have a significant direct effect on the development of reading comprehension in early readers beyond fluent decoding and oral language skills in languages with transparent orthography. The results also suggest that once children learn to decode well, their language skills (and not their executive functions) have a strong effect on the development of reading comprehension. Therefore, reading interventions in elementary school should stress on the development of oral language skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dolean","given":"Dacian Dorin"},{"family":"Lervåg","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Visu-Petra","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Melby-Lervåg","given":"Monica"}],"citation-key":"doleanLanguageSkillsNot2021","container-title":"Reading and Writing","container-title-short":"Read Writ","DOI":"10.1007/s11145-020-10107-4","ISSN":"0922-4777, 1573-0905","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1491-1512","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Language skills, and not executive functions, predict the development of reading comprehension of early readers: evidence from an orthographically transparent language","title-short":"Language skills, and not executive functions, predict the development of reading comprehension of early readers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11145-020-10107-4","volume":"34"},

Despite these changes, the Technical Handbook did not report results from exploratory factor analytic investigations, and confirmatory factor analyses were implemented using selected subtests across the normative age groups from the total battery. To address these omissions, the present study investigated the theoretical structure of the DAS-II using principal axis factoring followed by the Schmid–Leiman procedure with participants from the 5- to 8-year-old age range to determine the degree to which the DAS-II theoretical structure proposed in the Technical Handbook could be replicated. Unlike other age ranges investigated where at most 14 subtests were administered, the entire DAS-II battery was normed on participants aged 5 to 8 years, making it well suited to test the full instrument’s alignment with theory. Results suggested a six-factor solution that was essentially consistent with the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC)-based theoretical structure suggested by the test publisher and simple structure was attained. The only exception involved two subtests (Picture Similarities and Early Number Concepts) that did not saliently load on a group factor.

Exploratory bifactor analysis (EBFA; maximum likelihood extraction with a bigeomin [orthogonal] rotation) was applied to the two school-aged correlation matrices at ages 9 to 19. Results indicated nonalignment with CHC theory and do not support the interpretation of most of the scores suggested by the scoring system.

  {"id":"douglasEstimatingClassificationAccuracy2010","abstract":"Important decisions about students are made by combining multiple measures using complex decision rules. Although methods for characterizing the accuracy of decisions based on a single measure have been suggested by numerous researchers, such methods are not useful for estimating the accuracy of decisions based on multiple measures. This study presents a simulation method useful for estimating classification accuracy for any measurement model and complex decision rule. The utility of the method is demonstrated by application to actual data from General Educational Development (GED) test takers. Findings in this study illustrate how multiple scores that are combined can have a large impact on the accuracy of the resulting decision. Furthermore, choice of measure of agreement is of central importance in describing decision accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Mislevy","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"douglasEstimatingClassificationAccuracy2010","container-title":"Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics","container-title-short":"Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics","DOI":"10.3102/1076998609346969","ISSN":"1076-9986","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"280-306","publisher":"American Educational Research Association","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Estimating classification accuracy for complex decision rules based on multiple scores","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3102/1076998609346969","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"eronenTheoryCrisisPsychology2021","abstract":"Meehl argued in 1978 that theories in psychology come and go, with little cumulative progress. We believe that this assessment still holds, as also evidenced by increasingly common claims that psychology is facing a “theory crisis” and that psychologists should invest more in theory building. In this article, we argue that the root cause of the theory crisis is that developing good psychological theories is extremely difficult and that understanding the reasons why it is so difficult is crucial for moving forward in the theory crisis. We discuss three key reasons based on philosophy of science for why developing good psychological theories is so hard: the relative lack of robust phenomena that impose constraints on possible theories, problems of validity of psychological constructs, and obstacles to discovering causal relationships between psychological variables. We conclude with recommendations on how to move past the theory crisis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Eronen","given":"Markus I."},{"family":"Bringmann","given":"Laura F."}],"citation-key":"eronenTheoryCrisisPsychology2021","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691620970586","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"language":"en","page":"779-788","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The theory crisis in psychology: How to move forward","title-short":"The theory crisis in psychology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620970586","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"farmerReducingLowvaluePractices2021","abstract":"Through innovation in research and self-correction, it is inevitable that some practices will be replaced or be discredited for one reason or another. De-implementation of discredited and low-value practices is a necessary step for school psychologists’ maintenance of evidence-based practices and to reduce unnecessary costs and risk. However, efforts to clarify de-implementation frameworks and strategies are ongoing. The scope of this paper follows McKay et al. in considering the potential for de-implementation strategies to be informed by applied behavior analysis and operant learning theory. We conceptualize low-value practice as sets of behaviors evoked by their context and maintained by their consequences, and thus de-implementation as behavior reduction. We discuss the need for future research given this perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Farmer","given":"Ryan L."},{"family":"Zaheer","given":"Imad"},{"family":"Duhon","given":"Gary J."},{"family":"Ghazal","given":"Stephanie"}],"citation-key":"farmerReducingLowvaluePractices2021","container-title":"Canadian Journal of School Psychology","container-title-short":"Canadian Journal of School Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/0829573520974915","ISSN":"0829-5735","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC: 0000000","page":"166-185","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Reducing low-value practices: A functional-contextual consideration to aid in de-implementation efforts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0829573520974915","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"farmerWhyQuestionableAssessment2021","abstract":"Surveys reveal that many school psychologists continue to employ cognitive profile analysis despite the long-standing history of negative research results from this class of practice. This begets the question: why do questionable assessment practices persist in school psychology? To provide insight on this dilemma, this article presents the results of a content analyses of available interpretive resources in the clinical assessment literature that may shed insight on this issue. Although previous reviews have evaluated the content of individual assessment courses, this is the first systematic review of pedagogical resources frequently adopted in reading lists by course instructors. The interpretive guidance offered across tests within these texts was largely homogenous emphasizing the primary interpretation of subscale scores, de-emphasizing interpretation of global composites (i.e., FSIQ), and advocating for the use of some variant of profile analysis to interpret scores and score profiles. Implications for advancing evidence-based assessment in school psychology training and guarding against unwarranted unsupported claims in clinical assessment is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Farmer","given":"Ryan L."},{"family":"McGill","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Dombrowski","given":"Stefan C."},{"family":"Canivez","given":"Gary L."}],"citation-key":"farmerWhyQuestionableAssessment2021","container-title":"Canadian Journal of School Psychology","container-title-short":"Canadian Journal of School Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/0829573520978111","ISSN":"0829-5735, 2154-3984","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"language":"en","page":"98-114","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why questionable assessment practices remain popular in school psychology: Instructional materials as pedagogic vehicles","title-short":"Why questionable assessment practices remain popular in school psychology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0829573520978111","volume":"36"},

The origins of these problems are linked to the historical development of the profession which has provided school psychologists with a unique and distinctive role in administering IQ tests and using the results to make decisions about special educational provision for children with learning difficulties. This article reviews recent research that is heavily critical of the relevance of IQ testing and the associated medical model of working, and then considers some of the barriers which prevent school psychologists from changing their practices.

In a prior study, we found that preschool working memory, a component of cognitive control, predicts kindergarten academic competence and classroom engagement. In the present study, we assess whether preschool working memory contributes to high school dropout risk at age 13. Participants are 1824 children from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development who were individually assessed at ages 2.5 and 3.5 on working memory using the Imitation Sorting Task. Dropout risk, representing an index, comprised of grade retention history and concurrent school performance and engagement, was measured in spring of grade 7. We used logistic regression to estimate dropout risk from early childhood working memory while controlling for verbal and non-verbal IQ, socioeconomic status, and sex. A one point increase in children's working memory skills predicted a 26% reduction in the odds of being in the high risk group for dropout. Higher socioeconomic status and intellectual skills also predicted lower high school dropout risk. Individual differences in preschool working memory may contribute to early detection of later high school dropout risk. These results suggest the importance of further developing early effective interventions aimed at strengthening cognitive control in children.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Archambault","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Janosz","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Pagani","given":"Linda S."}],"citation-key":"fitzpatrickEarlyChildhoodWorking2015","container-title":"Intelligence","container-title-short":"Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.intell.2015.10.002","ISSN":"0160-2896","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,1]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC: 0000030","page":"160-165","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Early childhood working memory forecasts high school dropout risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001312","volume":"53"},

This study examined the contribution of executive function to comprehension of expository science text among adult readers, as well as the role of vocabulary ability in the relation between executive function and text comprehension. The roles of additional reader characteristics, including age, reading time, prior knowledge, and vocabulary ability, in comprehension were also examined. Using structural equation modeling, a latent executive function factor significantly predicted comprehension after accounting for age, reading time, prior knowledge, and vocabulary ability. Vocabulary ability mediated the relation between executive function and both lower-level and higher-level reading comprehension. Executive function contributed more strongly to lower-level compared with higher-level comprehension of the text. Implications for future research are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Follmer","given":"D.

  {"id":"freyScholasticAssessmentRelationship2004","abstract":"There is little evidence showing the relationship between the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and g (general intelligence). This research established the relationship between SAT and g, as well as the appropriateness of the SAT as a measure of g, and examined the SAT as a premorbid measure of intelligence. In Study 1, we used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Measures of g were extracted from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and correlated with SAT scores of 917 participants. The resulting correlation was .82 (.86 corrected for nonlinearity). Study 2 investigated the correlation between revised and recentered SAT scores and scores on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices among 104 undergraduates. The resulting correlation was .483 (.72 corrected for restricted range). These studies indicate that the SAT is mainly a test of g. We provide equations for converting SAT scores to estimated IQs; such conversion could be useful for estimating premorbid IQ or conducting individual difference research with college students.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Frey","given":"Meredith C."},{"family":"Detterman","given":"Douglas K."}],"citation-key":"freyScholasticAssessmentRelationship2004","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,6]]},"language":"en","page":"373-378","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scholastic Assessment or g?: The Relationship Between the Scholastic Assessment Test and General Cognitive Ability","title-short":"Scholastic Assessment or g?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x","volume":"15"},

Results indicated that students in the two tutored groups tended to perform comparably on all tests and to outperform controls (more so in grade 5 than grade 3) on near-transfer but not far-transfer measures of RC.

  {"id":"gambinoMisusePredictiveValue1991","abstract":"The predictive value of a test is often misinterpreted because it is presented as a percent. It is intuitive to assume that low percentages (70% or less) are \"bad\" and high percentages are \"good\". A positive predictive value of 20%, for example, was cited as proof that a test should not be used even though the positive likelihood ratio for that same test was 50. A likelihood ratio of 50 means that the post test odds of disease for a positive test result will be 50 times higher than the pretest odds of disease. Now, that is a large increase in the odds. Critics of laboratory medicine fail to recognize that sensitivity and specificity vary with the strength of the signal. Thus, a value well above the cutoff is far more likely to indicate disease than does a value just above the cutoff--even though both are reported as \"positive\". Tables of likelihood ratios for a wide range of specific test results, or for multiple test results, provide more information than a simple four-by-four predictive value table. Likelihood ratios are also more informative than predictive values or ROC curves. Finally, critics of laboratory medicine fail to take into account the information to be derived from a confirmatory test, a repeat test at a later time, and from other tests.","author":[{"family":"Gambino","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"gambinoMisusePredictiveValue1991","container-title":"Annali dell'Istituto Superiore Di Sanita","container-title-short":"Ann Ist Super Sanita","ISSN":"0021-2571","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"language":"eng","page":"395-399","PMID":"1809058","source":"PubMed","title":"The misuse of predictive value—or why you must consider the odds","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"gehlbachMeasureTwiceCut2011","abstract":"For years psychologists across many subfields have undertaken the formidable challenge of designing survey scales to assess attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Correspondingly, scholars have written much to guide researchers in this undertaking. Yet, many new scales violate established best practices in survey design, suggesting the need for a new approach to designing surveys. This article presents 6 steps to facilitate the construction of questionnaire scales. Unlike previous processes, this one front loads input from other academics and potential respondents in the item-development and revision phase with the goal of achieving credibility across both populations. Specifically, the article describes how (a) a literature review and (b) focus group–interview data can be (c) synthesized into a comprehensive list to facilitate (d) the development of items. Next, survey designers can subject the items to (e) an expert review and (f) cognitive pretesting before executing a pilot test.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gehlbach","given":"Hunter"},{"family":"Brinkworth","given":"Maureen E."}],"citation-key":"gehlbachMeasureTwiceCut2011","container-title":"Review of General Psychology","container-title-short":"Review of General Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0025704","ISSN":"1089-2680, 1939-1552","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"language":"en","page":"380-387","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measure twice, cut down error: A process for enhancing the validity of survey scales","title-short":"Measure twice, cut down error","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/a0025704","volume":"15"},

We used random-effects meta-regression models with robust variance estimates to summarize overall effects and to explore potential moderator effects. Results from a total of 33 rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted between 2002 and 2017 that met WWC evidence standards revealed a significant positive effect for reading interventions on reading outcomes, with a mean effect size of 0.39 (SE = .04, p < .001, 95% CI [0.32, 0.46]). Moderator analyses demonstrated that mean effects varied across outcome domains and areas of instruction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gersten","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Haymond","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Newman-Gonchar","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Dimino","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Jayanthi","given":"Madhavi"}],"citation-key":"gerstenMetaanalysisImpactReading2020","container-title":"Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness","DOI":"10.1080/19345747.2019.1689591","ISSN":"1934-5747","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/19345747.2019.1689591","page":"401-427","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Meta-analysis of the impact of reading interventions for students in the primary grades","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19345747.2019.1689591","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"gerstStructureProcessingSpeed2021","abstract":"The present study had two aims. First, we set out to evaluate the structure of processing speed in children by comparing five alternative models: two conceptual models (a unitary model, a complexity model) and three methodological models (a stimulus material model, an output response model, and a timing modality model). Second, we then used the resulting models to predict multiple types of reading, a highly important developmental outcome, using other well-known predictors as covariates. Participants were 844 children enrolled in third through fifth grade in urban public elementary schools who received 16 measures of processing speed that varied in the above dimensions. A two-factor complexity model that differentiated between simple and complex processing speed was the preferred model and fit the data well. Both types of PS predicted reading fluency, and complex (but not simple) PS predicted single word reading and comprehension. Results offer insight to the structure of processing speed, its relation to closely related concepts (such as executive function), and provide nuance to the understanding of the way processing speed influences reading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerst","given":"Elyssa H."},{"family":"Cirino","given":"Paul T."},{"family":"Macdonald","given":"Kelly T."},{"family":"Miciak","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Hanako"},{"family":"Woods","given":"Steven P."},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"M.

  {"id":"goldrick-rabStillHungryHomeless2018","abstract":"The Bottom Line:\n\nThis is the largest national survey assessing the basic needs security of university students. It is the HOPE Lab’s 3rd national survey; the other two focused on community colleges. This year we report on 43,000 students at 66 institutions in 20 states and the District of Columbia. That includes over 20,000 students at 35 4-year colleges and universities, as well as students at community colleges.\n\nWe find:\n• 36% of university students were food insecure in the 30 days preceding the survey. This year’s estimate for community college students is 42%, but our larger study last year found 56%.2\n• 36% of university students were housing insecure in the last year. Housing insecurity affected 51% of community college students in last year’s study, and 46% in this year’s study.\n• 9% of university students were homeless in the last year. In comparison, 12% of community college students were\nhomeless in this year’s survey, and 14% in last year’s survey.\n\nThe data show that basic needs insecurities disproportionately affect marginalized students and are associated with long work hours and higher risk of unemployment. However, the level of academic effort – in and outside the classroom—is the same regardless of whether or not students are dealing with food and housing insecurity. It is therefore critically important to match their commitments with supports to ensure degree completion.","author":[{"family":"Goldrick-Rab","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Jed"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Cady","given":"Claire"}],"citation-key":"goldrick-rabStillHungryHomeless2018","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"license":"All rights reserved","note":"pubid:MGPUR4WVBMEC","publisher":"The Wisconsin HOPE Lab","title":"Still hungry and homeless in college","type":"report","URL":"https://www.bhcc.edu/media/03-documents/voicesofhunger/Wisconsin-HOPE-Lab-Still-Hungry-and-Homeless-April-2018.pdf"},

The purpose of this special issue is to present contemporary research on various models of SLD identification as well as issues associated with their implementation. Each of the articles in this issue offers recommendations for improving SLD identification practices and, more broadly, academic service delivery in K–12 schools. This introduction reviews three SLD identification methods (i.e., aptitude–achievement discrepancy, patterns of cognitive processing strengths and weaknesses, and response-to-intervention approaches).

  {"id":"grattonCholinergicNotDopaminergic2017","abstract":"The neuromodulator acetylcholine modulates spatial integration in visual cortex by altering the balance of inputs that generate neuronal receptive fields. These cholinergic effects may provide a neurobiological mechanism underlying the modulation of visual representations by visual spatial attention. However, the consequences of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception in humans are unknown. We conducted two experiments to test whether enhancing cholinergic signaling selectively alters perceptual measures of visuospatial interactions in human subjects. In Experiment 1, a double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacology study, we measured how flanking distractors influenced detection of a small contrast decrement of a peripheral target, as a function of target-flanker distance. We found that cholinergic enhancement with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil improved target detection, and modeling suggested that this was mainly due to a narrowing of the extent of facilitatory perceptual spatial interactions. In Experiment 2, we tested whether these effects were selective to the cholinergic system or would also be observed following enhancements of related neuromodulators dopamine or norepinephrine. Unlike cholinergic enhancement, dopamine (bromocriptine) and norepinephrine (guanfacine) manipulations did not improve performance or systematically alter the spatial profile of perceptual interactions between targets and distractors. These findings reveal mechanisms by which cholinergic signaling influences visual spatial interactions in perception and improves processing of a visual target among distractors, effects that are notably similar to those of spatial selective attention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Acetylcholine influences how visual cortical neurons integrate signals across space, perhaps providing a neurobiological mechanism for the effects of visual selective attention. However, the influence of cholinergic enhancement on visuospatial perception remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that cholinergic enhancement improves detection of a target flanked by distractors, consistent with sharpened visuospatial perceptual representations. Furthermore, whereas most pharmacological studies focus on a single neurotransmitter, many neuromodulators can have related effects on cognition and perception. Thus, we also demonstrate that enhancing noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems does not systematically improve visuospatial perception or alter its tuning. Our results link visuospatial tuning effects of acetylcholine at the neuronal and perceptual levels and provide insights into the connection between cholinergic signaling and visual attention.","author":[{"family":"Gratton","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Yousef","given":"Sahar"},{"family":"Aarts","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Deanna L."},{"family":"D'Esposito","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Silver","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"grattonCholinergicNotDopaminergic2017","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1523/jneurosci.2405-16.2017","ISSN":"0270-6474","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"note":"_eprint: http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/16/4405.full.pdf","page":"4405–4415","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","title":"Cholinergic, but not dopaminergic or noradrenergic, enhancement sharpens visual spatial perception in humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/16/4405","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"greenCognitiveTrainingHow2020","abstract":"Both scientists and the general public want to know whether basic cognitive abilities can improve with dedicated behavioral training. This would have many practical implications, including possible increases in academic achievement. The current brief review of behavioral approaches to cognitive enhancement focuses on the cognitive abilities most predictive of academic success: fluid intelligence, working memory, executive functions, spatial thinking, and visual attention. Researchers are currently testing a range of possible approaches to enhancing these cognitive skills. These include everything from having people repeatedly practice the same types of psychology tests that are used to measure the cognitive abilities, to developing custom cognitive training platforms, to the use of commercial entertainment video games. Existing data warrant guarded optimism, but more research is needed to justify widespread adoption. Policymakers can help (e.g., by promoting best-practice science), and researchers need to consider ethical issues as the field progresses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"C.

The first approach is based on meta-analysis and incremental validity analysis research and the main assumption is that general mental ability (GMA) is the best job performance predictor regardless of the occupation. The second approach, referred to as specific validity theory, assumes that job-unique weighting of different specific mental abilities (SMA) is a better predictor of job performance than GMA and occupational context cannot be ignored when job performance is predicted. The validity study of both GMA and SMA as predictors of job performance across different occupational groups (N = 4033, k = 15) was conducted. The results were analyzed by calculating observed validity coefficients and with the use of the incremental validity and the relative importance analysis. The results supports the specific validity theory – SMA proved to be a valid job performance predictor and occupational context moderated GMA validity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Grobelny","given":"Jaroslaw"}],"citation-key":"grobelnyPredictiveValidityJob2018","container-title":"Business and Management Studies","container-title-short":"BMS","DOI":"10.11114/bms.v4i3.3297","ISSN":"2374-5924, 2374-5916","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]},"page":"1","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Predictive validity toward job performance of general and specific mental abilities.

When determining the curriculum and interventions used to teach, a collaborative team of caretakers and educators should consider use of current state and national standards when determining the scope and sequence in order to promote a healthy knowledge of sexuality while ensuring use of effective models with use of evidence-based interventions to teach sexuality education. In some cases, inappropriate sexual behaviors must be addressed through use of behavior analytic assessments in order to effectively address problem behavior while teaching healthy and appropriate sexual behavior. Additionally, it will be important for the collaborative team to address any risks and ramifications of not fully addressing sexuality education with individuals with IDD. Part of that process will be to ensure all caretakers responsible for teaching the curriculum are fully trained and familiar with all components of the curriculum as well as addressing any cultural norms or areas of discomfort that might hinder effective implementation of the teaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamrick","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"DiGangi","given":"E.

  {"id":"harris-watsonInteractionConscientiousnessGeneral2022","abstract":"We propose a compensatory interactive influence of conscientiousness and GMA in task performance such that conscientiousness is most beneficial to performance for low-GMA individuals. Drawing on trait by trait interaction theory and empirical evidence for a compensatory mechanism of conscientiousness for low GMA, we contrast our hypothesis with prior research on a conscientiousness-GMA interaction and argue that prior research considered a different interaction type. We argue that observing a compensatory interaction likely requires (a) considering the appropriate interaction form, including a possible curvilinear conscientiousness-performance relationship; (b) measuring the full conscientiousness domain (as opposed to motivation proxies); (c) narrowing the criterion domain to reflect task performance; and (d) appropriate psychometric scoring of variables to increase power and avoid type 1 error. In four employee samples (N1 = 300; N2 = 261; N3 = 1,413; N4 = 948), we test a conscientiousness-GMA interaction in two employee samples. In three of four samples, results support a nuanced compensatory mechanism such that conscientiousness compensates for low to moderate GMA, and high conscientiousness may be detrimental to or unimportant for task performance in high-GMA individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris-Watson","given":"Alexandra M."},{"family":"Kung","given":"Mei-Chuan"},{"family":"Tocci","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Boyce","given":"Anthony S."},{"family":"Weekley","given":"Jeff A."},{"family":"Guenole","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Nathan T."}],"citation-key":"harris-watsonInteractionConscientiousnessGeneral2022","container-title":"Journal of Business and Psychology","container-title-short":"J Bus Psychol","DOI":"10.1007/s10869-021-09780-1","ISSN":"1573-353X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,7]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"The interaction between conscientiousness and general mental ability: Support for a compensatory interaction in task performance","title-short":"The interaction between conscientiousness and general mental ability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-021-09780-1"},

  {"id":"haslamDimensionsCategoriesMetaanalysis2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            Taxometric procedures have been used extensively to investigate whether individual differences in personality and psychopathology are latently dimensional or categorical (‘taxonic’). We report the first meta-analysis of taxometric research, examining 317 findings drawn from 183 articles that employed an index of the comparative fit of observed data to dimensional and taxonic data simulations. Findings supporting dimensional models outnumbered those supporting taxonic models five to one. There were systematic differences among 17 construct domains in support for the two models, but psychopathology was no more likely to generate taxonic findings than normal variation (i.e. individual differences in personality, response styles, gender, and sexuality). No content domain showed aggregate support for the taxonic model. Six variables – alcohol use disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, problem gambling, autism, suicide risk, and pedophilia – emerged as the most plausible taxon candidates based on a preponderance of independently replicated findings. We also compared the 317 meta-analyzed findings to 185 additional taxometric findings from 96 articles that did not employ the comparative fit index. Studies that used the index were 4.88 times more likely to generate dimensional findings than those that did not after controlling for construct domain, implying that many taxonic findings obtained before the popularization of simulation-based techniques are spurious. The meta-analytic findings support the conclusion that the great majority of psychological differences between people are latently continuous, and that psychopathology is no exception.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Haslam","given":"Nick"},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Melanie J."},{"family":"Viechtbauer","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Kuppens","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"haslamDimensionsCategoriesMetaanalysis2020","container-title":"Psychological Medicine","container-title-short":"Psychol.

  {"id":"heVisualWorkingMemory2022","abstract":"Visual working memory (VWM) is typically measured using arrays of two-dimensional isolated stimuli with simple visual identities (e.g., color or shape), and these studies typically find strong capacity limits. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) experts are tasked with reasoning with representations of three-dimensional (3D) connected objects, raising questions about whether those stimuli would be subject to the same limits. Here, we use a color change detection task to examine working memory capacity for 3D objects made up of differently colored cubes. Experiment 1a shows that increasing the number of parts of an object leads to less sensitivity to color changes, while change-irrelevant structural dimensionality (the number of dimensions into which parts of the structure extend) does not. Experiment 1b shows that sensitivity to color changes decreases similarly with increased complexity for multipart 3D connected objects and disconnected 2D squares, while sensitivity is slightly higher with 3D objects. Experiments 2a and 2b find that when other stimulus characteristics, such as size and visual angle, are controlled, change-irrelevant dimensionality and connectivity have no effect on performance. These results suggest that detecting color changes on 3D connected objects and on displays of isolated 2D stimuli are subject to similar set size effects and are not affected by dimensionality and connectivity when these properties are change-irrelevant, ruling out one possible explanation for scientists’ advantages in storing and manipulating representations of complex 3D objects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Chuanxiuyue"},{"family":"Gunalp","given":"Peri"},{"family":"Meyerhoff","given":"Hauke S."},{"family":"Rathbun","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Stieff","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Franconeri","given":"Steven L."},{"family":"Hegarty","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"heVisualWorkingMemory2022","container-title":"Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications","container-title-short":"Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications","DOI":"10.1186/s41235-022-00367-9","ISSN":"2365-7464","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,19]]},"page":"19","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Visual working memory for connected 3D objects: effects of stimulus complexity, dimensionality and connectivity","title-short":"Visual working memory for connected 3D objects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-022-00367-9","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"holdenIntelligenceCanBe2021","abstract":"In the US, undeniable evidence shows that socioeconomic inequities explain a high proportion of individual differences in school achievement. Although not all countries show this same effect due to socioeconomic status, it is consistently found that social inequities lead to achievement gaps. These achievement gaps then manifest into trajectories that set some individuals on a path of lower incomes, poorer health and higher mortality, lower wellbeing, and other poor adult outcomes. Like James Flynn so handily reminded the scientific literature that achievement gaps are explainable by environmental factors, the inequities we see around the world are based on environments some children are exposed to. In his work, Flynn stated his belief that the suppression of scientific work on intelligence would continue to lead to social inequities. We wish to take this idea and move it forward. We believe that the scientific construct of intelligence plays a key role in helping create a more equitable society through science. We also believe that the poor perception of intelligence, rooted in historical realities, means that it will continue to be misunderstood, feared, and misused, limiting how effective it could be in helping to close gaps in achievement and in creating a more equitable society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Holden","given":"LaTasha R."},{"family":"Hart","given":"Sara A."}],"citation-key":"holdenIntelligenceCanBe2021","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires that all U.S. states, jurisdictions, and territories submit plans to the Secretary of Education that demonstrate that the state has adopted challenging academic content and student achievement standards. As part of that plan, states and school districts that receive Title I funds must participate in NAEP assessments in reading and math at grades 4 and 8 every two years. The purpose of NAEP has always been to survey what students know and can do and to monitor changes over time. Now, NAEP has a new role, to act as a serious discussion tool in evaluating results of state assessments and in providing a common base for comparison between states.

Subtest profile analysis from traditional cognitive assessment has drawn sharp criticism for inaccurate identification and weak connections to educational planning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use a new generation of cognitive tests with megacluster analysis to augment diagnosis and the instructional process.The Cognitive Assessment System uses a contemporary theoretical model in which composite scores, instead of subtest scores, are used for profile analysis. Ten core profiles from a regular education sample ( N = 1,692) and 12 profiles from a sample of students with LD ( N = 367) were found. The majority of the LD profiles were unique compared with profiles obtained from the general education sample.

The artifacts range from writing systems to computers. In everyday life, a person demonstrates intelligence by showing skill in using these artifacts. Intelligence tests and their surrogates force examinees to exhibit some of these skills but not others. This is why test scores correlate substantially but not perfectly with a variety of measures of socioeconomic success. The same thing is true at the international level. Nations can be evaluated by the extent to which their citizens score well on cognitive tests, including both avowed intelligence tests and a variety of tests of academic achievement. The resulting scores are substantially correlated with various indices of national wealth, health, environmental quality, and schooling and with a vaguer variable, social commitment to innovation. These environmental variables are suggested as causes of the differences in general cognitive skills between national populations. It is conceivable that differences in gene pools also contribute to international and, within nations, group differences in cognitive skills, but at present it is impossible to evaluate the extent of genetic influences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunt","given":"Earl"}],"citation-key":"huntWhatMakesNations2012","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691612442905","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"284-306","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What makes nations intelligent?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691612442905","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"jaeggiShortLongtermBenefits2011","abstract":"Does cognitive training work? There are numerous commercial training interventions claiming to improve general mental capacity; however, the scientific evidence for such claims is sparse. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence that certain cognitive interventions are effective. Here we provide evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive (often called “brain”) training. However, we demonstrate that there are important individual differences that determine training and transfer. We trained elementary and middle school children by means of a videogame-like working memory task. We found that only children who considerably improved on the training task showed a performance increase on untrained fluid intelligence tasks. This improvement was larger than the improvement of a control group who trained on a knowledge-based task that did not engage working memory; further, this differential pattern remained intact even after a 3-mo hiatus from training. We conclude that cognitive training can be effective and long-lasting, but that there are limiting factors that must be considered to evaluate the effects of this training, one of which is individual differences in training performance. We propose that future research should not investigate whether cognitive training works, but rather should determine what training regimens and what training conditions result in the best transfer effects, investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms, and finally, investigate for whom cognitive training is most useful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaeggi","given":"Susanne M."},{"family":"Buschkuehl","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Jonides","given":"John"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Priti"}],"citation-key":"jaeggiShortLongtermBenefits2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"johnsonCognitiveProcessingDeficits2010","abstract":"Many practitioners and state education agency staff would likely agree that the accuracy and consistency of specific learning disability (SLD) eligibility decisions is in need of improvement. One component of the SLD definition particularly controversial in the identification procedures is the evaluation of cognitive processes, primarily due to a lack of information about the role they might play in informing an SLD diagnosis and eligibility for special education services. A meta-analysis of 32 studies was conducted to examine the cognitive processing differences between students with SLD and typically achieving peers. The analysis found moderately large to large effect sizes in cognitive processing differences between groups of students with SLD and typically achieving students. These differences are of sufficient magnitude to justify including measures of cognitive processing ability in the evaluation and identification of SLD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Evelyn S."},{"family":"Humphrey","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mellard","given":"Daryl F."},{"family":"Woods","given":"Kari"},{"family":"Swanson","given":"H.

  {"id":"jungThreeIndividualDifference2019","abstract":"The study of human individual differences has matured significantly, in the last decade or so owing, in part, to the notable advances in neuroimaging techniques. There are three major domains of inquiry within individual differences research: personality, creativity, and intelligence. Each has a discrete, testable definition (a new definition for intelligence is offered: rapid and accurate problem solving), and each has been associated with distinct brain regions and interactive networks. Here, we outline commonalities between these constructs, which appear to conform to two major axes: exploratory behavior and restraint. These axes, in turn, conform largely to two major brain networks dedicated to novelty generation (i.e. default mode network — DMN), and refinement of ideas (i.e. cognitive control network — CCN). Thus, human individual differences represent the expression of adaptive behaviors leading to exploratory and/or restrained action arising from brain structure and function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Rex E"},{"family":"Chohan","given":"Muhammad O"}],"citation-key":"jungThreeIndividualDifference2019","collection-title":"Creativity","container-title":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.03.002","ISSN":"2352-1546","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC: 0000002","page":"163-168","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Three individual difference constructs, one converging concept: adaptive problem solving in the human brain","title-short":"Three individual difference constructs, one converging concept","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154618301232","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"kaneWhatMindWandering2012","abstract":"People’s minds sometimes wander from ongoing activities. Although these experiences can be pleasant and useful, they are often unintentional and precipitate mistakes. In this article, we adopt an individual-differences perspective in considering unwanted mind wandering as an indicator of both momentary failures of and enduring deficiencies in executive-control functions. We describe research that associates normal variation in working memory capacity (WMC)—a cognitive ability that broadly predicts intellectual capabilities and accomplishments—with off-task thinking. In laboratory and daily-life assessments, people with lower WMC mind wander more frequently than do those with higher WMC, at least during demanding tasks. Moreover, the error-proneness of lower-WMC subjects seems to arise partly from their vulnerability to mind wandering. Executive control over one’s thoughts therefore seems to contribute to the effective regulation of behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kane","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"McVay","given":"Jennifer C."}],"citation-key":"kaneWhatMindWandering2012","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721412454875","ISSN":"0963-7214, 1467-8721","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10]]},"language":"en","page":"348-354","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What mind wandering reveals about executive-control abilities and failures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721412454875","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"kanniainenAssessingReadingOnline2021","abstract":"This study evaluated the relation between sixth graders' (N = 426) teacher-rated difficulties in attention and executive function (EF) and their comprehension skills. Reading comprehension was assessed with a multiple-choice task and online research and comprehension (ORC) with a problem-solving task. The analyses were controlled for gender, reading fluency and nonverbal reasoning. To investigate differences in students' performance between the tasks, comprehension skills in the multiple-choice task were also controlled for in the ORC task. Structural equation models showed that teacher-rated attention and EF difficulties were related to students' performance more in the problem-solving task than in the multiple-choice task. After controlling for all the background variables, these difficulties explained 9% of the variance of ORC performance in girls and 4% in boys. These results indicate that for students with attention and EF difficulties the ORC task was more challenging than the reading comprehension task.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanniainen","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Kiili","given":"Carita"},{"family":"Tolvanen","given":"Asko"},{"family":"Aro","given":"Mikko"},{"family":"Anmarkrud","given":"Øistein"},{"family":"Leppänen","given":"Paavo H.

Experiment 1 examined the relationship between strategy knowledge, verbal WM, and visual-spatial WM in children with MD as a function of initial, gain, and maintenance conditions. The results showed that after partialing the influence of reading, stable strategy choices rather than specific strategy knowledge was related to verbal and visual-spatial WM span in high demand (maintenance) conditions. Experiment 2 compared children with MD to a group of chronological age-matched children and a group of math ability-matched children on the same conditions as Experiment 1. Age-matched children's verbal and visual-spatial WM performance was superior to that of children with MD, whereas WM performance was statistically comparable between children with MD and younger children matched on math ability. The selection of expert strategies was related to high WM span scores in the initial conditions. After controlling for reading achievement in a regression analysis, verbal and visual-spatial WM, stable verbal strategy choices, and expert strategy choices related to visual-spatial processing all contributed independent variance to math achievement. Overall, these results suggest that WM and math achievement are related to strategy knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Keeler","given":"Marsha L."},{"family":"Swanson","given":"H.

Factor analyses of the K-ABC standardization data generally offer support for the validity of the two mental processing scales, but analyses including the achievement tests have been considerably less supportive. For the present study, data from the standardization sample were used to test alternate structures for the K-ABC, based on the hypothesis that the test measures verbal memory skills, and verbal and nonverbal reasoning. Hierarchical factor models based on this structure were developed and tested using confirmatory techniques. Results suggest that the models fit the data fairly well, thus supporting the validity of this alternate structure. Of particular interest was the finding of the virtual equivalence of the verbal reasoning factor and the second order, or general ability, factor.

In one of the earliest examples of using CFA to test for invariance, multigroup-CFA was used to test for invariance of covariance structures. The chapter deals with a \"simple\" CFA model, and gradually moves to CFA methods that provide a more complete evaluation of the theories underlying tests (e.g., hierarchical analysis, the comparison of alternative models, testing hypotheses about tests and constructs, and multisample analyses). Before illustrating the comparison of competing alternative models, it is worth illustrating an alternative method of scaling the factors. The chapter shows an alternative model of the constructs measured by the Kaufman Adult and Adolescent Intelligence Test. Like a higher-order model, a bifactor model includes both general intelligence and more narrow abilities, but all are first-order factors. An individually administered test of intelligence will generally take an hour and a half to administer, and substantial sample sizes are needed.

  {"id":"kievitMutualisticCouplingVocabulary2017","abstract":"One of the most replicable findings in psychology is the positive manifold: the observation that individual differences in cognitive abilities are universally positively correlated. Investigating the developmental origin of the positive manifold is crucial to understanding it. In a large longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults ( N = 784; n = 563 across two waves, mean interval between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14–25 years), we examined developmental changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kievit","given":"Rogier A."},{"family":"Lindenberger","given":"Ulman"},{"family":"Goodyer","given":"Ian M."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Fonagy","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bullmore","given":"Edward T."},{"literal":"the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network"},{"family":"Dolan","given":"Raymond J."}],"citation-key":"kievitMutualisticCouplingVocabulary2017","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797617710785","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1419-1431","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mutualistic coupling between vocabulary and reasoning supports cognitive development during late adolescence and early adulthood","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617710785","volume":"28"},

Results from 350 English-speaking second graders revealed that language and cognitive component skills had direct and indirect relations to listening comprehension, explaining 86% of variance. Word reading and listening comprehension completely mediated the relations of language and cognitive component skills to reading comprehension and explained virtually all the variance in reading comprehension. Total effects of component skills varied from small to substantial. The findings support the direct and indirect effects model of reading model and indicate that word reading and listening comprehension are upper-level skills that are built on multiple language and cognitive component skills, which have direct and indirect relations among themselves. The results underscore the importance of understanding nature of relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Young-Suk Grace"}],"citation-key":"kimWhySimpleView2017","container-title":"Scientific Studies of Reading","DOI":"10.1080/10888438.2017.1291643","ISSN":"1088-8438","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,4]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10888438.2017.1291643","page":"310-333","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Why the simple view of reading is not simplistic: Unpacking component skills of reading using a direct and indirect effect model of reading (DIER)","title-short":"Why the simple view of reading is not simplistic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10888438.2017.1291643","volume":"21"},

Estimates of Gc and Gs/Glr were based on five KTEA-3 subtests that measure either Gc (e.g., Listening Comprehension) or Gs/Glr (e.g., Object Naming Facility). The two groups were then compared on math error factors. Significant differences favored the High-Gc group for factors that measure math calculation, basic math concepts, and complex computation. However, the two groups did not differ in their errors on factors that measure geometry/measurement or simple addition.

This general cognitive ability is supposed to explain the positive manifold, the finding that intelligence tests with different content all correlate. Yet there is a lack of consensus regarding the psychological or neural basis of such an ability. A recent account, process-overlap theory, explains the positive manifold without proposing general intelligence. As a consequence of the theory, IQ is redefined as an emergent formative construct rather than a reflective latent trait.

  {"id":"kwokCrossWithindomainAssociations2021","abstract":"Existing research has mainly examined the role of cognitive correlates of early reading and mathematics from a stationary perspective that does not consider how these skills unfold and interact over time. This approach constraints the interpretation of cross-domain associations and the specificity of domain-specific covariates. In this study, we disentangle the role of these predictors and investigate cross-domain associations between reading, math, and two related domain-specific predictors (phonological awareness and fluency with number sets) over the kindergarten years (n=512, Mage=54months, SDage=3.5, 52% females). Results reveal that the overlap between reading and math skills changes over development. Reciprocal associations between reading and math abilities are observed at earlier stages; then, reading abilities become the lead force. Findings also show that phonological awareness and fluency with number sets are domain-specific predictors that do not contribute to cross-domain gains in academic skills. Indeed, there is a trend for domain-specific skills to be more strongly related to achievement at the beginning of formal education than at the beginning of kindergarten, which suggests an increasing differentiation of domains over the kindergarten years. Such findings have implications for the timing and nature of interventions that aim to support children’s reading and mathematical development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kwok","given":"Fu Yu"},{"family":"Bull","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Muñez","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"kwokCrossWithindomainAssociations2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Cross- and within-domain associations of early reading and mathematical skills: Changes across the preschool years","title-short":"Cross- and within-domain associations of early reading and mathematical skills","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.710470","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"langerSharedDecisionmakingYouth2021","abstract":"Objective: Engaging youth and caregivers as active collaborators in the treatment planning process is a patient-centered approach with the potential to facilitate the personalization of established evidence-based treatments. This study is the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate shared decision-making (SDM) to plan youth psychotherapy. Method: Forty youth (7–15 years; 33% ethnic minority) were randomly assigned to psychosocial treatment planned using SDM (n = 20) or planned primarily by the clinician (n = 20). In the SDM condition, clinicians guided youth and caregivers through a collaborative treatment planning process that relies on research findings to inform three primary decisions: (a) treatment target problem(s), (b) treatment participants, and (c) treatment techniques. Assessments occurred at baseline, following treatment planning, midtreatment, and post-treatment. Results: Youth and caregivers in the SDM condition reported significantly greater involvement in the treatment planning process compared to their counterparts in the clinician-guided condition (U = 123.00, p = .037; U = 84.50, p = .014, respectively) and SDM caregivers reported significantly lower decisional conflict (U = 72.00, p = .004) and decisional regret (U = 73.50, p = .020). Supporting the feasibility of successful SDM implementation, there were no significant differences between conditions on treatment length, satisfaction with decisions, or engagement. There were no significant diagnostic or symptom differences between conditions. Conclusions: Planning psychosocial treatments in collaboration with youth and caregivers is a promising way to support youth and caregiver autonomy and plan evidence-based treatments that are responsive to patient preferences, culture, and values.

  {"id":"lervagUnpickingDevelopmentalRelationship2018","abstract":"Listening comprehension and word decoding are the two major determinants of the development of reading comprehension. The relative importance of different language skills for the development of listening and reading comprehension remains unclear. In this 5-year longitudinal study, starting at age 7.5 years (n = 198), it was found that the shared variance between vocabulary, grammar, verbal working memory, and inference skills was a powerful longitudinal predictor of variations in both listening and reading comprehension. In line with the simple view of reading, listening comprehension, and word decoding, together with their interaction and curvilinear effects, explains almost all (96%) variation in early reading comprehension skills. Additionally, listening comprehension was a predictor of both the early and later growth of reading comprehension skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Lervåg","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Hulme","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Melby-Lervåg","given":"Monica"}],"citation-key":"lervagUnpickingDevelopmentalRelationship2018","container-title":"Child Development","DOI":"10.1111/cdev.12861","ISSN":"1467-8624","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cdev.12861","page":"1821-1838","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Unpicking the developmental relationship between oral language skills and reading comprehension: It's simple, but complex","title-short":"Unpicking the developmental relationship between oral language skills and reading comprehension","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.12861","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"letinaExpandingNetworkAnalysis2019","abstract":"The analysis of psychological networks in previous research has been limited to the inspection of centrality measures and the quantification of specific global network features. The main idea of this paper is that a psychological network entails more potentially useful and interesting information that can be reaped by other methods widely used in network science. Specifically, we suggest methods that provide clearer picture about hierarchical arrangement of nodes in the network, address heterogeneity of nodes in the network, and look more closely at network’s local structure. We explore the potential value of minimum spanning trees, participation coefficients, and motif analyses and demonstrate the relevant analyses using a network of 26 psychological attributes. Using these techniques, we investigate how the network of different psychological concepts is organized, which attribute is most central, and what the role of intelligence in the network is relative to other psychological variables. Applying the three methods, we arrive at several tentative conclusions. Trait Empathy is the most “central” attribute in the network. Intelligence, although peripheral, is weakly but equally related to different kinds of attributes present in the network. Analysis of triadic configurations additionally shows that the network is characterized by relatively strong open triads and an unusually frequent occurrence of negative triangles. We discuss these and other findings in the light of possible theoretical explanations, methodological limitations, and future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Letina","given":"Srebrenka"},{"family":"Blanken","given":"Tessa F."},{"family":"Deserno","given":"Marie K."},{"family":"Borsboom","given":"Denny"}],"citation-key":"letinaExpandingNetworkAnalysis2019","container-title":"Complexity","container-title-short":"Complexity","DOI":"10.1155/2019/9424605","ISSN":"1076-2787, 1099-0526","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1-27","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Expanding network analysis tools in psychological networks: Minimal spanning trees, participation coefficients, and motif analysis applied to a network of 26 psychological attributes","title-short":"Expanding network analysis tools in psychological networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2019/9424605/","volume":"2019"},

  {"id":"lynottEffectHapticAmbient2017","abstract":"SCIENTIFIC  Research in social embodied cognition has found numerous positive associations between higher temperatures and prosocial behavior, with “warmer is better” effects demonstrating greater altruism, social proximity, and affective attributions. However, recent failures to replicate experimental findings in this area have called some effects into question. By contrast, epidemiological research has frequently observed that higher ambient temperatures are correlated with increases in societal volatility and antisocial behaviors, with “warmer is worse” effects demonstrated by increases in warfare, city-center rioting, and sporting aggression. Using a sample size (N = 611) larger than many previous studies in the social priming domain, we examined whether higher ambient temperature and/or higher prop temperature (i.e., holding a hot/cold therapeutic pack) lead to more prosocial behavior. Results showed that warmer ambient temperatures were weakly associated with more prosocial than selfish choices. However, calculation of Bayes Factors suggests that the evidence is better characterized as inconclusive. As previously published analyses of the same data set used in this study show (Lynott et al., 2014), prop temperature did not lead to increased prosocial responding, which fails to support predictions from particular accounts of social embodiment. We discuss possible reasons for the inconclusive findings and for the broad range of effect sizes observed more generally in the literature.

  {"id":"malanchiniEvidenceUnitaryStructure2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Performance in everyday spatial orientation tasks (e.g., map reading and navigation) has been considered functionally separate from performance on more abstract object-based spatial abilities (e.g., mental rotation and visualization). However, few studies have examined the link between spatial orientation and object-based spatial skills, and even fewer have done so including a wide range of spatial tests. To examine this issue and more generally to test the structure of spatial ability, we used a novel gamified battery to assess six tests of spatial orientation in a virtual environment and examined their association with ten object-based spatial tests, as well as their links to general cognitive ability (\n              g\n              ). We further estimated the role of genetic and environmental factors in underlying variation and covariation in these spatial tests. Participants (\n              N\n               = 2660; aged 19–22) were part of the Twins Early Development Study. The six tests of spatial orientation clustered into a single ‘\n              Navigation’\n              factor that was 64% heritable. Examining the structure of spatial ability across all 16 tests, three, substantially correlated, factors emerged:\n              Navigation\n              ,\n              Object Manipulation\n              , and\n              Visualization\n              . These, in turn, loaded strongly onto a general factor of\n              Spatial Ability\n              , which was highly heritable (84%). A large portion (45%) of this high heritability was independent of\n              g\n              . The results point towards the existence of a common genetic network that supports all spatial abilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Malanchini","given":"Margherita"},{"family":"Rimfeld","given":"Kaili"},{"family":"Shakeshaft","given":"Nicholas G."},{"family":"McMillan","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Schofield","given":"Kerry L."},{"family":"Rodic","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Valerio"},{"family":"Kovas","given":"Yulia"},{"family":"Dale","given":"Philip S."},{"family":"Tucker-Drob","given":"Elliot M."},{"family":"Plomin","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"malanchiniEvidenceUnitaryStructure2020","container-title":"npj Science of Learning","container-title-short":"npj Sci.

  {"id":"martelMultipleInformantAverage2021","abstract":"To date, there remains no consensus about the best evidence-based method for integrating multiple informant data in the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Several approaches exist, including the psychometrically sound approach of averaging scores, as well as the use of “OR” and “AND” algorithms, which are still commonly used in research. The current study tested these major integration methods in their concurrent and longitudinal prediction of clinician-rated impairment, teacher-rated academic, and parent- and self-rated social skill ratings in children overrecruited for ADHD across a 6-year span from childhood to adolescence. The sample included a total of 800 children, 480 with ADHD, ages 6 to 13, who completed a “gold standard” assessment of ADHD and associated impairment. Overall, the “OR,” “AND,” and average integration approaches showed significantly high interrelations with one another (r range from .78 to .96) and were all significantly and strongly related to impairment measures concurrently and longitudinally. Multivariate regressions demonstrated that the average integration approach concurrently and longitudinally out predicted the other two approaches. Results demonstrated that the average approach slightly outperformed the other two in its prediction of concurrent and longitudinal clinician-rated impairment, teacher-rated academic skills, and parent- and self-rated child social skills across childhood and adolescence. Evidence-based assessment integration of parent and teacher ratings of ADHD in childhood might best utilize an averaging approach, as it is most related to later impairment ratings, particularly if such findings are replicated by other groups.

Although reports should be written in the most efficient and reader-friendly manner, this is not always the case.

The focus of the current article is to provide an integrated and easily implemented framework for improving psychoeducational reports based on the evidence and broad recommendations currently available in the literature.

To wit, Hale et al. (Psychology in the Schools, 45, 838–858, (2008)) posit that cognitive scatter is a defining characteristic of specific learning disability and that individuals with learning disabilities may have higher levels of scatter compared to normal controls. To investigate the tenability of this claim, the present study employed diagnostic efficiency statistics and other recommended psychometric methods (e.g., receiver operative characteristic curve, Bayesian nomogram) to test whether cognitive scatter could accurately distinguish between individuals with and without a known learning disability (LD) diagnosis in the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition KABC-II; Kaufman and Kaufman (2004a) normative sample. Results indicated that increasing levels of cognitive profile scatter identified individuals with LD at no better than chance levels. The current negative results add to a growing corpus of research questioning the utility of many of the interpretive procedures that are utilized by school psychologists for commercial ability measures. In particular, it is suggested that clinicians who interpret cognitive profile scatter may risk diagnostic overconfidence and in the case of LD identification, unacceptable levels of false positive decisions attributable to error.

  {"id":"mcgillCriticalIssuesSpecific2016","abstract":"As a result of the upcoming Federal reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), practitioners and researchers have begun vigorously debating what constitutes evidence-based assessment for the identification of specific learning disability (SLD). This debate has resulted in strong support for a method that appraises an individual’s profile of cognitive test scores for the purposes of determining cognitive processing strengths and weaknesses, commonly referred to as patterns of strengths and weaknesses (PSW). Following the Fuchs and Deshler model, questions regarding the psychometric and conceptual integrity of the PSW model are addressed. Despite the strong claims made by many PSW proponents, the findings by this review demonstrate the need for additional information to determine whether PSW is a viable alternative to existing eligibility models and worthy for large scale adoption for SLD identification. Implications for public policy and future SLD research are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"McGill","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Styck","given":"Kara M."},{"family":"Palomares","given":"Ronald S."},{"family":"Hass","given":"Michael R."}],"citation-key":"mcgillCriticalIssuesSpecific2016","container-title":"Learning Disability Quarterly","container-title-short":"Learning Disability Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0731948715618504","ISSN":"0731-9487, 2168-376X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"language":"en","page":"159-170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Critical issues in specific learning disability identification: What we need to know about the PSW model","title-short":"Critical Issues in Specific Learning Disability Identification","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0731948715618504","volume":"39"},
  {"id":"mcgillElaboratingLinkageCognitive2018","abstract":"Within the school psychology literature, it is frequently asserted that deficits in cognitive processing are a defining characteristic of children with academic dysfunction, and establishing links between relevant cognitive and academic weaknesses is a core pillar of patterns of strengths and weaknesses assessment models. Accordingly, the present study employed diagnostic utility statistics to determine whether the presence of a significant cognitive weakness accurately distinguishes between participants with and without academic weaknesses ages 7 years 0 months to 18 years 11 months in the linked Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–Second Edition (Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004a) and Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement–Second Edition (Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004b) normative sample. Sensitivity and positive predictive values for the CHC-related broad abilities ranged from low to moderate, indicating that a cognitive weakness may not be robust a rule-in indicator for the presence of an academic weakness. Conversely, specificity and negative predictive values were consistently high, indicating that, absent a cognitive weakness, it is unlikely that an individual will present with an academic weakness.

  {"id":"mcgillInvalidatingFullScale2016","abstract":"Within the professional literature, it is frequently suggested that significant variability in lower-level factor and index scores on IQ tests renders the resulting FSIQ an inappropriate focus for clinical interpretation and diagnostic decision-making. To investigate the tenability of this popular interpretive heuristic, the present study examined the structural and predictive validity of the KABC-II for participants in the normative sample who were observed to have significant variability in their factor scores. Participants were children and adolescents, ages 7-18, (N = 2,025) drawn from the KABC-II/KTEA-II standardization sample. The sample was nationally stratified and proportional to U.S. census estimates for sex, ethnicity, geographic region, and parent education level. Using exploratory factor analysis and multiple factor extraction criteria, support for a five-factor extraction was obtained consistent with publisher theory. As recommended by Carroll (1993; 1995) hierarchical structure was explicated by sequentially partitioning variance appropriately to higher- and lower-order dimensions. Results showed the largest portions of total and common variance were accounted for by the second-order general factor with meaningful residual variance accounted for by Short-Term Memory at ages 7-12 and 13-18. As a result, the Fluid-Crystallized Index (FCI) accounted for large predictive effects across measures of academic achievement whereas the five first-order CHC factor scores consistently accounted for trivial proportions of incremental predictive variance beyond the FCI.

The central tenet of this article is that SPs need to integrate motivation alongside affective and cognitive constructs vis-à-vis an updated trilogy-of-the-mind (cognitive, conative, affective) model of intellectual functioning. CAMML builds on Richard Snow’s seminal research on academic aptitudes—which are not synonymous with cognitive abilities. Learning aptitude complexes are academic domain-specific cognitive abilities and personal investment mechanisms (motivation and self-regulation) that collectively produce a student’s readiness to learn in a specific domain. CAMML incorporates the “crossing the Rubicon” commitment pathway model of motivated self-regulated learning. It is recommended SPs take a fresh look at motivation theory, constructs, and research, embedded in the CAMML aptitude framework, by going back-to-the-future guided by the wisdom of giants from the field of cognition, intelligence, and educational psychology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"McGrew","given":"Kevin S."}],"citation-key":"mcgrewCognitiveaffectivemotivationModelLearning2022","container-title":"Canadian Journal of School Psychology","container-title-short":"Canadian Journal of School Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/08295735211054270","ISSN":"0829-5735, 2154-3984","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3]]},"language":"en","page":"117-134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The cognitive-affective-motivation model of learning (CAMML): Standing on the shoulders of giants","title-short":"The cognitive-affective-motivation model of learning (CAMML)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08295735211054270","volume":"37"},

This article presents a meta-analysis of working memory training studies (with a pretest-posttest design and a control group) that have examined transfer to other measures (nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension, or arithmetic; 87 publications with 145 experimental comparisons). Immediately following training there were reliable improvements on measures of intermediate transfer (verbal and visuospatial working memory). For measures of far transfer (nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension, arithmetic) there was no convincing evidence of any reliable improvements when working memory training was compared with a treated control condition. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that across studies, the degree of improvement on working memory measures was not related to the magnitude of far-transfer effects found. Finally, analysis of publication bias shows that there is no evidential value from the studies of working memory training using treated controls. The authors conclude that working memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize to measures of “real-world” cognitive skills. These results seriously question the practical and theoretical importance of current computerized working memory programs as methods of training working memory skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Melby-Lervåg","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Redick","given":"Thomas S."},{"family":"Hulme","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"melby-lervagWorkingMemoryTraining2016","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691616635612","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7]]},"language":"en","page":"512-534","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Working memory training does not improve performance on measures of intelligence or other measures of “far transfer”: evidence from a meta-analytic review","title-short":"Working memory training does not improve performance on measures of intelligence or other measures of “far transfer”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616635612","volume":"11"},

Here we investigated neural responses during spoken word rhyme judgments in typical and impaired ESL readers in China. The impaired readers showed comparable activation in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), but reduced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and left fusiform and reduced connectivity between the LSTG and left fusiform when compared to typical readers. These findings suggest that impaired ESL readers have relative intact representations but impaired manipulation of phonology and reduced or absent automatic access to orthographic representations. This is consistent with previous findings in native English speakers and suggests a common neural mechanism underlying English impairment across the L1 and L2 learners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Meng","given":"Xiangzhi"},{"family":"You","given":"Hanlin"},{"family":"Song","given":"Meixia"},{"family":"Desroches","given":"Amy S."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhengke"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Na"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Mengyu"},{"family":"Gaab","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Guosheng"}],"citation-key":"mengNeuralDeficitsAuditory2016","container-title":"Bilingualism: Language and Cognition","DOI":"10.1017/S1366728915000073","ISSN":"1366-7289, 1469-1841","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3]]},"language":"en","page":"331-346","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Neural deficits in auditory phonological processing in Chinese children with English reading impairment*","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/neural-deficits-in-auditory-phonological-processing-in-chinese-children-with-english-reading-impairment/09DC5DBC129E459FBA820D90F9DB6C9C","volume":"19"},

Nonmetric two-dimensional MDS maps were selected for interpretation. The most cognitively complex subtests and indexes were located near the center of the maps. Subtests were also grouped together in the way that they are organized in the primary and complementary indexes, and not necessarily on content surface features. Naming Speed and Symbol Translation scores may be better off kept as separate indexes, and Digit Span Sequencing appeared to add more complexity to the Digit Span subtest. One implication related to score interpretation is that General Ability Index (GAI) and Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI) may be distinguished by the level of complexity of the subtests included in each index (i.e., more complex subtests included in GAI and less complex subtests included in the CPI).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Matthew R."}],"citation-key":"meyerScoresSpaceMultidimensional2018b","container-title":"Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment","container-title-short":"Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment","DOI":"10.1177/0734282917696935","ISSN":"0734-2829, 1557-5144","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","page":"562-575","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scores in Space: Multidimensional Scaling of the WISC-V","title-short":"Scores in Space","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0734282917696935","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"miciakCriticalRoleInstructional2020","abstract":"This article addresses the nature of dyslexia and best practices for identification and treatment within the context of multitier systems of support (MTSS). We initially review proposed definitions of dyslexia to identify key commonalities and differences in proposed attributes. We then review empirical evidence for proposed definitional attributes, focusing on key sources of controversy, including the role of IQ, instructional response, as well as issues of etiology and immutability. We argue that current empirical evidence supports a dyslexia classification marked by specific deficits in reading and spelling words combined with inadequate response to evidence-based instruction. We then propose a “hybrid” dyslexia identification process built to gather data relevant to these markers of dyslexia. We argue that this assessment process is best implemented within school-wide MTSS because it leverages data routinely collected in well-implemented MTSS, including documentation of student progress and fidelity of implementation. In contrast with other proposed methods for learning disability (LD) identification, the proposed “hybrid” method demonstrates strong evidence for valid decision-making and directly informs intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Miciak","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Jack M."}],"citation-key":"miciakCriticalRoleInstructional2020","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/0022219420906801","ISSN":"0022-2194, 1538-4780","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"language":"en","page":"343-353","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The critical role of instructional response for identifying dyslexia and other learning disabilities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022219420906801","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"millerComparingThreePatterns2016","abstract":"Processing Strengths and Weaknesses (PSW) models have been proposed as a method for identifying specific learning disabilities. Three PSW models were examined for their ability to predict expert identified specific learning disabilities cases. The Dual Discrepancy/Consistency Model (DD/C; Flanagan, Ortiz, &amp; Alfonso, 2013) as operationalized by the Cross Battery Assessment Software (X-BASS; Ortiz, Flanagan &amp; Alfonso, 2015), the Concordance-Discordance Model (C-DM; Hale &amp; Fiorello, 2004), and the Psychological Processing Analyzer software (PPA v3.1; Dehn, 2015b) were evaluated. The DD/C approach as represented with the X-BASS system had a 100% agreement with the expert panel in the identification of specific learning disabilities and non-specific learning disabilities cases. The C-DM model was more conservative, identifying only 45% of the specific learning disabilities cases. The PPA software was too limited to be used in the study and is not recommended for use in identifying specific learning disabilities via a PSW approach. Although more research is needed, the results of this study would suggest that the DD/C and X-BASS provide the greatest utility for a PSW approach to identifying specific learning disabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"Maricle","given":"Denise E."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Alicia M."}],"citation-key":"millerComparingThreePatterns2016","container-title":"Learning Disabilities: A Multidisciplinary Journal","DOI":"10.18666/LDMJ-2016-V21-I2-7349","ISSN":"2374-7846","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,11]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2018 Sagamore Publishing LLC","number":"2","source":"js.sagamorepub.com","title":"Comparing three patterns of strengths and weaknesses models for the identification of specific learning disabilities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://js.sagamorepub.com/ldmj/article/view/7349","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"nagyMaturationWhiteMatter2004","abstract":"Abstract\n            In the human brain, myelination of axons continues until early adulthood and is thought to be important for the development of cognitive functions during childhood. We used diffusion tensor MR imaging and calculated fractional anisotropy, an indicator of myelination and axonal thickness, in children aged between 8 and 18 years. Development of working memory capacity was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy in two regions in the left frontal lobe, including a region between the superior frontal and parietal cortices.\n            Reading ability, on the other hand, was only correlated with fractional anisotropy in the left temporal lobe, in the same white matter region where adults with reading disability are known to have lower fractional anisotropy. Both the temporal and the frontal regions were also correlated with age. These results show that maturation of white matter is an important part of brain maturation during childhood, and that maturation of relatively restricted regions of white matter is correlated with development of specific cognitive functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagy","given":"Zoltan"},{"family":"Westerberg","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Klingberg","given":"Torkel"}],"citation-key":"nagyMaturationWhiteMatter2004","container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1162/0898929041920441","ISSN":"0898-929X, 1530-8898","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1227-1233","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Maturation of white matter is associated with the development of cognitive functions during childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/16/7/1227/3907/Maturation-of-White-Matter-is-Associated-with-the","volume":"16"},

Performance on overlearned and concrete information was superior to novel conceptual learning and global (as opposed to local) information processing. Mathematics problem solving was more impaired than early reading skills. Frontal/executive functions were significantly impaired. Adaptive behavioral skill development was less impaired, falling in the low average range overall. Comparison of twins A and B documented significant differences in all areas except fine motor speed, with largest differences observed in dorsal stream visuospatial/constructional functions and working memory. Social perception and complex fine motor coordination were impaired in proband but not brother.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion\n\nThe current findings are consistent with previous reports that Sotos syndrome may present with evidence of a mixed right hemisphere learning disability and a profile of executive function impairments. These findings point to the necessity of evaluating individuals with Sotos syndrome at a neuropsychological level, as reliance upon more global intelligence test scores inadequately describes their abilities.","author":[{"family":"Nicholls","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Ross","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"}],"citation-key":"nichollsNeuropsychologicalProfilesTwins2016","event-place":"Las Vegas, NV","event-title":"American Academy of Pediatric Neuropsychology Annual Conference","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,15]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher-place":"Las Vegas, NV","title":"The neuropsychological profiles of twins discordant for Sotos Syndrome: A case study","type":"speech"},

  {"id":"papadopoulosStructureSpeedProcessing2018","abstract":"We examined whether a general processing factor emerges when using response times for cognitive processing tasks and whether such a factor is valid across three different cultural groups (Chinese, Canadian, and Greek). Three hundred twenty university students from Canada (n = 115), China (n = 110), and Cyprus (n = 95) were assessed on an adaptation of the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (D-N CAS; ). Three alternative models were contrasted: a distinct abilities processing speed model (Model 1) that is dictated by the latent four cognitive factors of planning, attention, simultaneous and successive (PASS) processing, a unitary ability processing speed model (Model 2) that is dictated by the response time nature of all measures, and a bifactor model (Model 3) which included the latent scores of Models 1 and 2 and served as the full model. Results of structural equation modeling showed that (a) the model representing processing speed as a collection of four cognitive processes rather than a unitary processing speed factor was the most parsimonious, and (b) the loadings of the obtained factors were invariant across the three cultural groups. These findings enhance our understanding of the nature of speed of processing across diverse cultures and suggest that even when cognitive processes (i.e., PASS) are operationalized with response time measures, the processing component dominates speed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"Timothy C."},{"family":"Georgiou","given":"George K."},{"family":"Deng","given":"Ciping"},{"family":"Das","given":"J.

  {"id":"pattersonMolecularGeneticAnalysis2009","abstract":"Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) and is the most common genetic cause of significant intellectual disability. In addition to intellectual disability, many other health problems, such as congenital heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, hypotonia, motor disorders, and various physical anomalies occur at an elevated frequency in people with DS. On the other hand, people with DS seem to be at a decreased risk of certain cancers and perhaps of atherosclerosis. There is wide variability in the phenotypes associated with DS. Although ultimately the phenotypes of DS must be due to trisomy of HSA21, the genetic mechanisms by which the phenotypes arise are not understood. The recent recognition that there are many genetically active elements that do not encode proteins makes the situation more complex. Additional complexity may exist due to possible epigenetic changes that may act differently in DS. Numerous mouse models with features reminiscent of those seen in individuals with DS have been produced and studied in some depth, and these have added considerable insight into possible genetic mechanisms behind some of the phenotypes. These mouse models allow experimental approaches, including attempts at therapy, that are not possible in humans. Progress in understanding the genetic mechanisms by which trisomy of HSA21 leads to DS is the subject of this review.","author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"pattersonMolecularGeneticAnalysis2009","container-title":"Human Genetics","DOI":"10.1007/s00439-009-0696-8","ISSN":"1432-1203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,7,1]]},"page":"195–214","title":"Molecular genetic analysis of Down syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-009-0696-8","volume":"126"},

  {"id":"pengCognitiveElementModel2020","abstract":"The science of reading emphasizes explicit skills-based reading instruction to support students’ reading acquisition. Yet, despite ample evidence of support, some students do not respond to such instruction adequately. To characterize why some students are not responsive to evidence-based reading instruction and to inform the development of novel instructional approaches for improving responsiveness, cross-disciplinary perspectives on cognitive and academic development are important. Based on the cognitive–academic bidirectional theory, on cognitive training transfer theory, and on various working memory–reading models, the authors propose a cognitive element model of reading instruction that provides a novel framework for considering how to embed supports for cognitive processes within evidence-based reading instruction. Specifically, the element model emphasizes building reading fluency and comprehension/knowledge with explicit instruction. Working memory should not be considered a domain-general construct in working memory training that aims to produce far-transfer effects on reading outcomes. Instead of looking for far-transfer effects, we should make outcomes (i.e., reading) near-transfer tasks such that working memory training should be domain (material) specific, task paradigm specific, and strategy specific and assimilated within existing skill-based reading activities. The authors review intervention studies with rigorous methodology and show promising effects of this framework. With the element model, the authors provide a foundation for considering how one can use extant knowledge of evidence-based reading instruction together with knowledge of related skills in other domains (e.g., cognitive psychology) to maximize the efficacy of reading instruction for all students.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Goodrich","given":"J.

In fall of first grade, 185 students identified as at-risk for reading difficulties were assessed on measures of domain-specific skills (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and vocabulary), domain-general skills (working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and processing speed), and word reading and reading comprehension. Word reading and reading comprehension were assessed again in spring of grades 1–4. Individual growth curve modeling showed that the children demonstrated decelerated growth on word reading and linear growth on reading comprehension, although their performance on both word reading and reading comprehension were consistently below average on national norms. After controlling for word reading and reading comprehension in first grade, letter knowledge predicted growth in word reading; vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning predicted growth in reading comprehension. That is, we found different developmental trajectories and different predictors for word reading and reading comprehension among our at-risk sample. Implications are discussed for theory and early reading instruction for at-risk children.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Lynn S."},{"family":"Elleman","given":"Amy M."},{"family":"Kearns","given":"Devin M."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Jennifer K."},{"family":"Compton","given":"Donald L."},{"family":"Cho","given":"Eunsoo"},{"family":"Patton","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"pengLongitudinalAnalysisTrajectories2019","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/0022219418809080","ISSN":"0022-2194","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"195-208","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"A longitudinal analysis of the trajectories and predictors of word reading and reading comprehension development among at-risk readers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022219418809080","volume":"52"},
  {"id":"pengMetaanalyticReviewCognition2022","abstract":"Based on 378 studies, 541 independent samples, and over 34,000 participants, the current meta-analysis aimed to explore the associations between cognition and reading difficulties (RD). Results showed that compared with age-matched typically developing (TD) peers, RD showed deficits across processing speed, short-term memory, attention, working memory, inhibition, switching, visuospatial skills, and updating (g = −0.72 to −0.48), with more individual differences in inhibition, processing speed, switching, attention, visuospatial skills, and short-term memory (The natural logarithm of ratio of standard deviations [SDR] = .03–.17). The cognitive deficits among those with RD were more severe with age, with lower reading and intelligence (IQ) scores, and with verbal cognitive tasks. Individual differences in cognitive skills among those with RD were larger with age, with comprehensive/nonverbal IQ identification, and with reading comprehension identification. Comorbidity did not affect the cognitive profile of RD strongly. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling showed phonological processing and language comprehension explained over 70% of the variance between RD and TD across cognitive skills, yet executive function and visuospatial skills contributed uniquely to RD. These findings highlight a domain-specific cognitive path to RD. That is, cognitive deficits may lead to insufficient language development, causing RD indirectly. However, the association between cognitive deficits and RD is not unidirectional or static. Across development, insufficient accumulation of language skills among those with RD also affects cognitive development, especially in the verbal domain. Without high-quality and sustained instruction, such reciprocal associations between cognitive deficits and RD, forming a vicious circle, may be one major reason for persistent reading struggles among individuals with RD.

  {"id":"petersonHowSpecificAre2021","abstract":"Despite historical emphasis on “specific” learning disabilities (SLDs), academic skills are strongly correlated across the curriculum. Thus, one can ask how specific SLDs truly are. To answer this question, we used bifactor models to identify variance shared across academic domains (academic g), as well as variance unique to reading, mathematics, and writing. Participants included 686 children aged 8 to 16. Although the sample was overselected for learning disabilities, we intentionally included children across the full range of individual differences in this study in response to growing recognition that a dimensional, quantitative view of SLD is more accurate than a categorical view. Confirmatory factor analysis identified five academic domains (basic reading, reading comprehension, basic math, math problem-solving, and written expression); spelling clustered with basic reading and not writing. In the bifactor model, all measures loaded significantly on academic g. Basic reading and mathematics maintained variance distinct from academic g, consistent with the notion of SLDs in these domains. Writing did not maintain specific variance apart from academic g, and evidence for reading comprehension-specific variance was mixed. Academic g was strongly correlated with cognitive g (r = .72) but not identical to it. Implications for SLD diagnosis are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Peterson","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Lauren M."},{"family":"Willcutt","given":"Erik G."},{"family":"Keenan","given":"Janice M."},{"family":"Olson","given":"Richard K."},{"family":"Pennington","given":"Bruce F."}],"citation-key":"petersonHowSpecificAre2021","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/0022219420982981","ISSN":"0022-2194","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,14]]},"language":"en","page":"0022219420982981","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"How specific are learning disabilities?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022219420982981"},

  {"id":"procopioGeneticsSpecificCognitive2022","abstract":"Abstract\n          Most research on individual differences in performance on tests of cognitive ability focuses on general cognitive ability (g), the highest level in the three-level Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) hierarchical model of intelligence. About 50% of the variance of g is due to inherited DNA differences (heritability) which increases across development. Much less is known about the genetics of the middle level of the CHC model, which includes 16 broad factors such as fluid reasoning, processing speed, and quantitative knowledge. We provide a meta-analytic review of 863,041 monozygotic-dizygotic twin comparisons from 80 publications for these middle-level factors, which we refer to as specific cognitive abilities (SCA). Twin comparisons were available for 11 of the 16 CHC domains. The average heritability across all SCA is 55%, similar to the heritability of g. However, there is substantial differential heritability and the SCA do not show the dramatic developmental increase in heritability seen for g. We also investigated SCA independent of g (g-corrected SCA, which we refer to as SCA.g). A surprising finding is that SCA.g remain substantially heritable (53% on average), even though 25% of the variance of SCA that covaries with g has been removed. Our review frames expectations for genomic research that will use polygenic scores to predict SCA and SCA.g. Genome-wide association studies of SCA.g are needed to create polygenic scores that can predict SCA profiles of cognitive abilities and disabilities independent of g. These could be used to foster children’s cognitive strengths and minimise their weaknesses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Procopio","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Quan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ziye"},{"family":"Gidziela","given":"Agnieska"},{"family":"Rimfeld","given":"Kaili"},{"family":"Malanchini","given":"Margherita"},{"family":"Plomin","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"procopioGeneticsSpecificCognitive2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.02.05.479237","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,8]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Genetics","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The genetics of specific cognitive abilities","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.02.05.479237"},

  {"id":"puenteDevelopmentLargeOutpatient2020","abstract":"SCIENTIFIC  The use of improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, and landmines in recent wars has raised awareness into the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, 893 active duty military personnel were administered a comprehensive evaluation that included extensive premorbid functioning e.g., Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), structured interview, as well as psychological and neuropsychological testing postdeployment. In this first publication on this dataset, we first present the approach taken to obtain, record, clean, and analyze the data. Over 1 million data points are presented in a descriptive fashion to provide an initial overview of the information obtained by grouping individuals into four groups: (a) blast only; (b) PTSD only; (c) comorbid blast and PTSD; and (d) neither blast nor PTSD. Findings using this dataset have the potential to meaningfully add to the understanding of deployment-related mTBI and PTSD. The robustness of a demographically and psychometrically extensive dataset is discussed, as well as the inclusion of blast and PTSD groups and the value of premorbid data.

Data were extracted from 138 included manuscripts to evaluate the use of phonemic awareness instruction with children suspected of having a reading disability. A random effects model was then used to conduct a meta-analysis of these data with regard to child outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              \n                Gains in this population associated with phonemic awareness instruction can vary as a function of the outcome being used.

It was hypothesized that dynamic testing with graduated prompting and trial-by-trial-assessment could reveal the development of children’s strategy use while tested. The participants were indigenous Dutch and ethnic minority children. Trial-by-trial-testing provided information of how strategy use developed during training. Experimental-group children showed significant changes towards more advanced strategies. Ethnic minority children showed most strategy changes during training, initially needing more prompting but progressively requiring less. The study provided insight into strategy use during and after training. Pretest strategy level was found to be the first predictor of posttest strategy level, followed by condition and ethnicity. Age, gender, and intelligence test scores did not change this order.

First-order, higher-order, and bifactor confirmatory factor models were used. Results were compared with two recent studies using higher-order and bifactor exploratory factor analysis (Canivez, Watkins, & Dombrowski, 2015; Dombrowski, Canivez, Watkins, & Beaujean, 2015) and two using confirmatory factor analysis (Canivez, Watkins, & Dombrowski, 2016; Chen, Zhang, Raiford, Zhu, & Weiss, 2015). We found evidence of age-invariance for the constructs measured by the WISC-V. Further, both g and five distinct broad abilities (Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial Ability, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed) were needed to explain the covariances among WISC-V subtests, although Fluid Reasoning was nearly equivalent to g. These findings were consistent whether a higher-order or a bifactor hierarchical model was used, but they were somewhat inconsistent with factor analyses from the prior studies. We found a correlation between Fluid Reasoning and Visual Spatial factors beyond a general factor (g) and that Arithmetic was primarily a direct indicator of g. Composite scores from the WISC-V correlated well with their corresponding underlying factors. For those concerned about the fewer numbers of subtests in the Full Scale IQ, the model implied relation between g and the FSIQ was very strong.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Keith","given":"Timothy Z."}],"citation-key":"reynoldsMultigroupHierarchicalConfirmatory2017","container-title":"Intelligence","container-title-short":"Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.intell.2017.02.005","ISSN":"0160-2896","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-47","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Multi-group and hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Fifth Edition: What does it measure?","title-short":"Multi-group and hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Fifth Edition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961630201X","volume":"62"},

  {"id":"robertsonThresholdHypothesisEven2010","abstract":"The assertion that ability differences no longer matter beyond a certain threshold is inaccurate. Among young adolescents in the top 1% of quantitative reasoning ability, individual differences in general cognitive ability level and in specific cognitive ability pattern (that is, the relationships among an individual’s math, verbal, and spatial abilities) lead to differences in educational, occupational, and creative outcomes decades later. Whereas ability level predicts the level of achievement, ability pattern predicts the realm of achievement. Adding information on vocational interests refines prediction of educational and career choices. Finally, lifestyle preferences relevant to career choice, performance, and persistence often change between ages 25 and 35. This change results in sex differences in preferences, which likely have relevance for understanding the underrepresentation of women in careers that demand more than full-time (40 hours per week) commitment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Robertson","given":"Kimberley Ferriman"},{"family":"Smeets","given":"Stijn"},{"family":"Lubinski","given":"David"},{"family":"Benbow","given":"Camilla P."}],"citation-key":"robertsonThresholdHypothesisEven2010","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721410391442","ISSN":"0963-7214, 1467-8721","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12]]},"language":"en","page":"346-351","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Beyond the threshold hypothesis: Even among the gifted and top math/science graduate students, cognitive abilities, vocational interests, and lifestyle preferences matter for career choice, performance, and persistence","title-short":"Beyond the threshold hypothesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721410391442","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"robinaughNetworkApproachPsychopathology2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            The network approach to psychopathology posits that mental disorders can be conceptualized and studied as causal systems of mutually reinforcing symptoms. This approach, first posited in 2008, has grown substantially over the past decade and is now a full-fledged area of psychiatric research. In this article, we provide an overview and critical analysis of 363 articles produced in the first decade of this research program, with a focus on key theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions. In addition, we turn our attention to the next decade of the network approach and propose critical avenues for future research in each of these domains. We argue that this program of research will be best served by working toward two overarching aims: (a) the identification of robust empirical phenomena and (b) the development of formal theories that can explain those phenomena. We recommend specific steps forward within this broad framework and argue that these steps are necessary if the network approach is to develop into a progressive program of research capable of producing a cumulative body of knowledge about how specific mental disorders operate as causal systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinaugh","given":"Donald J."},{"family":"Hoekstra","given":"Ria H.

  {"id":"schmankInvestigatingStructureIntelligence2021","abstract":"In a recent publication in the Journal of Intelligence, Dennis McFarland mischaracterized previous research using latent variable and psychometric network modeling to investigate the structure of intelligence. Misconceptions presented by McFarland are identified and discussed. We reiterate and clarify the goal of our previous research on network models, which is to improve compatibility between psychological theories and statistical models of intelligence. WAIS-IV data provided by McFarland were reanalyzed using latent variable and psychometric network modeling. The results are consistent with our previous study and show that a latent variable model and a network model both provide an adequate fit to the WAIS-IV. We therefore argue that model preference should be determined by theory compatibility. Theories of intelligence that posit a general mental ability (general intelligence) are compatible with latent variable models. More recent approaches, such as mutualism and process overlap theory, reject the notion of general mental ability and are therefore more compatible with network models, which depict the structure of intelligence as an interconnected network of cognitive processes sampled by a battery of tests. We emphasize the importance of compatibility between theories and models in scientific research on intelligence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmank","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Goring","given":"Sara Anne"},{"family":"Kovacs","given":"Kristof"},{"family":"Conway","given":"Andrew R.

  {"id":"schmankPsychometricNetworkAnalysis2019","abstract":"The positive manifold—the finding that cognitive ability measures demonstrate positive correlations with one another—has led to models of intelligence that include a general cognitive ability or general intelligence (g). This view has been reinforced using factor analysis and reflective, higher-order latent variable models. However, a new theory of intelligence, Process Overlap Theory (POT), posits that g is not a psychological attribute but an index of cognitive abilities that results from an interconnected network of cognitive processes. These competing theories of intelligence are compared using two different statistical modeling techniques: (a) latent variable modeling and (b) psychometric network analysis. Network models display partial correlations between pairs of observed variables that demonstrate direct relationships among observations. Secondary data analysis was conducted using the Hungarian Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition (H-WAIS-IV). The underlying structure of the H-WAIS-IV was first assessed using confirmatory factor analysis assuming a reflective, higher-order model and then reanalyzed using psychometric network analysis. The compatibility (or lack thereof) of these theoretical accounts of intelligence with the data are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmank","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Goring","given":"Sara Anne"},{"family":"Kovacs","given":"Kristof"},{"family":"Conway","given":"Andrew R.

  {"id":"schmitzMeneMeneTekel2019","abstract":"Current taxonomies of intelligence comprise two factors of mental speed, clerical speed (Gs), and elementary cognitive speed (Gt). Both originated from different research traditions and are conceptualized as dissociable constructs in current taxonomies. However, previous research suggests that tasks of one category can be transferred into the other category by simply changing the mode of administration, i.e., in form of a paper-and-pencil test or in from of a computer-based elementary cognitive task. However, cross-mode correlations for specific tasks are usually only moderate. In the present study, mental speed was assessed as a broad construct across different tasks and stimulus materials. This allowed modeling mental speed as a hierarchical construct for paper-and-pencil as well as for computer-based tests. Cross-mode correlations of the respective general factors were moderate (r = 0.64), while the cross-mode correlations of task-specific components depended on task type (r = 0.12 to r = 0.71). Only the g factors of mental speed, but not the task-specific components, were found to be related with working memory capacity as a marker of cognitive ability. The speed general factor modeled across computer-based tests was more highly correlated with working memory capacity (r = 0.66) than the general factor modeled across paper-and-pencil tests (r = 0.46). These findings corroborate a crucial role of the assessment method and imply that validity of speed tests is affected by the choice of the test format.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmitz","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Wilhelm","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"schmitzMeneMeneTekel2019","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"schneiderEssentialsAssessmentReport2018","abstract":"\"The bestselling guide to reporting writing, updated and reworked for today's practice Essentials of Assessment Report Writing offers effective solutions to the creation of reader-friendly, yet targeted, psychological, and educational assessment reports. Parents, clinicians, clients, and other readers need more than test-by-test descriptions&mdash;they need an accessible analysis of the entire situation to determine their next steps. This book provides clear guidance for busy practitioners seeking ways to improve their report writing skills. With a focus on current practice, this new second edition covers DSM-5 updates and the latest assessment instruments including the WJ IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV, KTEA-3, and the CAS2. New discussion includes advice on tailoring the report to the audience, and annotated case reports provide illustrative models of effective report styles, interpretation, and analysis. Key concepts are highlighted for quick reference throughout, and end-of-chapter questions help reinforce understanding. Reporting styles vary widely within the field, in both content and style; there is no definitive \"standard,\" but many reports fail to reflect best practices and therefore prove less than useful to the reader. This book provides expert guidance throughout the reporting process to help practitioners provide high-quality, accessible reports. Integrate assessment results to provide a person-centered report Identify and navigate critical decision points in the interpretive process Write efficiently yet effectively while enhancing the reader's experience Provide an accurate, informative, and readable assessment report Incorporate practical recommendations to address the referral concerns Expertly-conducted assessments should culminate with a carefully constructed analysis that provides direction via clear communication. Because this report will be used to inform treatment, intervention, and ultimately, the client's quality of life&mdash;it is critical that it provides clear, informative guidance in a way that readers can understand. Essentials of Assessment Report Writing provides comprehensive guidelines for navigating through the report writing process\"--","author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"},{"family":"Mather","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Lichtenberger","given":"Elizabeth O."},{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Nadeen L."}],"call-number":"RC469","citation-key":"schneiderEssentialsAssessmentReport2018","collection-editor":[{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Alan S."},{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Nadeen L."}],"collection-title":"Essentials of psychological assessment","edition":"2","event-place":"Hoboken, NJ","ISBN":"978-1-119-21874-6 978-1-119-21875-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"license":"All rights reserved","note":"pubid:pUxgyZctzPYC","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Wiley","publisher-place":"Hoboken, NJ","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Essentials of assessment report writing","type":"book","URL":"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Essentials+of+Assessment+Report+Writing%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119218753"},

In this presentation, we will cover: What does research tell us about how the various CHC ability constructs relate to everyday difficulties at home, school, and work? How does one integrate a nuanced understanding of a person’s cognitive abilities with an empathic understanding of the whole person in their unique context?\n\nHow can one best communicate useful information about CHC abilities in an assessment report and face-to-face meetings?

(‘African language’ is the term used to denote the indigenous languages of black populations in southern Africa). A two-way ANOVA revealed highly significant effects for both level and quality of education within the black African first language group. Scores for the white English and black African first language groups with advantaged education were comparable with the US standardization, whereas scores for black African first language participants with disadvantaged education were significantly lower than this. Thus indications from this research are that normative studies should take account of the influential variable of quality of education, in addition to level of education. Alternatively faulty conclusions may be drawn about the effects of ethnicity, with the potential for neuropsychological misdiagnosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Shuttleworth-Edwards","given":"Ann B."},{"family":"Kemp","given":"Ryan D."},{"family":"Rust","given":"Annegret L."},{"family":"Muirhead","given":"Joanne G.L."},{"family":"Hartman","given":"Nigel P."},{"family":"Radloff","given":"Sarah E."}],"citation-key":"shuttleworth-edwardsCrossculturalEffectsIQ2004","container-title":"Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology","DOI":"10.1080/13803390490510824","ISSN":"1380-3395","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,10,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13803390490510824","page":"903-920","PMID":"15742541","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Cross-cultural Effects on IQ Test Performance: A Review and Preliminary Normative Indications on WAIS-III Test Performance","title-short":"Cross-cultural Effects on IQ Test Performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13803390490510824","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"simonsBraintrainingProgramsWork2016","abstract":"In 2014, two groups of scientists published open letters on the efficacy of brain-training interventions, or “brain games,” for improving cognition. The first letter, a consensus statement from an international group of more than 70 scientists, claimed that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded way to improve cognitive functioning or to stave off cognitive decline. Several months later, an international group of 133 scientists and practitioners countered that the literature is replete with demonstrations of the benefits of brain training for a wide variety of cognitive and everyday activities. How could two teams of scientists examine the same literature and come to conflicting “consensus” views about the effectiveness of brain training?\n            In part, the disagreement might result from different standards used when evaluating the evidence. To date, the field has lacked a comprehensive review of the brain-training literature, one that examines both the quantity and the quality of the evidence according to a well-defined set of best practices. This article provides such a review, focusing exclusively on the use of cognitive tasks or games as a means to enhance performance on other tasks. We specify and justify a set of best practices for such brain-training interventions and then use those standards to evaluate all of the published peer-reviewed intervention studies cited on the websites of leading brain-training companies listed on Cognitive Training Data ( www.cognitivetrainingdata.org ), the site hosting the open letter from brain-training proponents. These citations presumably represent the evidence that best supports the claims of effectiveness.\n            Based on this examination, we find extensive evidence that brain-training interventions improve performance on the trained tasks, less evidence that such interventions improve performance on closely related tasks, and little evidence that training enhances performance on distantly related tasks or that training improves everyday cognitive performance. We also find that many of the published intervention studies had major shortcomings in design or analysis that preclude definitive conclusions about the efficacy of training, and that none of the cited studies conformed to all of the best practices we identify as essential to drawing clear conclusions about the benefits of brain training for everyday activities. We conclude with detailed recommendations for scientists, funding agencies, and policymakers that, if adopted, would lead to better evidence regarding the efficacy of brain-training interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Simons","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Boot","given":"Walter R."},{"family":"Charness","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Gathercole","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Chabris","given":"Christopher F."},{"family":"Hambrick","given":"David Z."},{"family":"Stine-Morrow","given":"Elizabeth A.

  {"id":"smidScienceEffectiveCognitive2020","abstract":"A long-standing question in the behavioral sciences is whether cognitive functions can be improved through dedicated training. It is uncontested that training programs can lead to near transfer, meaning increased performance on untrained tasks involving similar cognitive functions. However, whether training also leads to far transfer, meaning increased performance on loosely related untrained tasks or even activities of daily living, is still hotly debated. Here, we review the extant literature and, in particular, the most recent meta-analytic evidence and argue that the ongoing crisis in the field of cognitive-training research may benefit from taking a more mechanistic approach to studying the effectiveness of training. We propose that (a) adopting a more rigorous theoretical framework that builds on a process-based account of training and transfer, (b) considering the role of individual differences in the responsiveness to training, and (c) drawing on Bayesian models of development may help to solve controversial issues in the field and lead the way to designing and implementing more effective training protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Smid","given":"Claire R."},{"family":"Karbach","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Steinbeis","given":"Nikolaus"}],"citation-key":"smidScienceEffectiveCognitive2020","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721420951599","ISSN":"0963-7214, 1467-8721","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"531-537","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Toward a science of effective cognitive training","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721420951599","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"sparksNativeLanguagePredictors2006","abstract":"Fifty-four students were tested at specific time intervals over 10 years to determine best native language (NL) predictors of oral and written foreign language (FL) proficiency and FL aptitude. All participants completed two years of Spanish, French, or German. Each was administered measures of NL literacy, oral language, and cognitive ability in elementary school. A measure of FL aptitude was administered at the beginning of ninth grade and FL proficiency was evaluated at the end of the 10th grade. Among the variables, NL literacy measures were the best predictors of FL proficiency, and NL achievement and general (verbal) intelligence were strong predictors of FL aptitude. Results suggest that indices of NL literacy as early as first grade are related to FL proficiency and FL aptitude nine and 10 years later. Findings provide strong support for connections between L1 and L2 skills, and for speculation that “lower level” skills in phonological processing are important for written language development and oral proficiency in a FL.","author":[{"family":"Sparks","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Patton","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Ganschow","given":"Leonore"},{"family":"Humbach","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Javorsky","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"sparksNativeLanguagePredictors2006","container-title":"Annals of Dyslexia","DOI":"10.1007/s11881-006-0006-2","ISSN":"1934-7243","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"129–160","title":"Native language predictors of foreign language proficiency and foreign language aptitude","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11881-006-0006-2","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"stankovOveremphasized2017","abstract":"In this paper I argue that the emphasis on “g” has become a hindrance to the study of broadly defined human cognitive abilities. Abilities captured by the first- and second-stratum factors in the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory have been neglected. The focus has been on a narrow range of cognitive processes that excludes those common to some sensory modalities and a host of new tasks and constructs that have become available through recent conceptual analyses and technological developments. These new areas have emerged from psychology itself (complex problem solving tasks and emotional intelligence) and from disciplines related to psychology like education and economics (economic games and cognitive biases in decision-making).","author":[{"family":"Stankov","given":"Lazar"}],"citation-key":"stankovOveremphasized2017","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","DOI":"10.3390/jintelligence5040033","ISSN":"2079-3200","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"33","title":"Overemphasized “g”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/5/4/33","volume":"5"},

Yet, it is not clear that “general intelligence” or g, traditionally conceptualized in terms of a general factor in a psychometrically-based hierarchical model of intelligence, provides an optimal way of defining intelligence as adaptation to the environment. Such a definition of adaptive intelligence would need to be biologically based in terms of evolutionary theory, would need to take into account the cultural context of adaptation, and would need to take into account whether thought and behavior labeled as “adaptively intelligent” actually contributed to the perpetuation of the human and other species, or whether it was indifferent or actually destructive to this perpetuation. In this article, I consider the similarities and differences between “general intelligence” and “adaptive intelligence,” as well as the implications especially of the differences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Sternberg","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"sternbergTheoryAdaptiveIntelligence2019","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

Test-usage estimates and importance ratings for well-established standardized instruments, newly revised or released instruments, and informal procedures such as interview and curriculum-based assessment were examined. Estimates of time involved in various service delivery activities also were obtained. Results indicated that assessment activities still account for about 50% of the practice hours of school psychologists, followed by consultation (20%) and treatment (19%). School psychologists reported frequent use of intellectual, behavior-social-emotional, achievement, and perceptual assessment methods, but were less likely to be involved in vocational or preschool assessment. Familiar instruments, such as the Wechsler scales, the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-educational Battery-Revised, the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised, the Bender-Visual Motor Gestalt, the Beery Developmental Test of Motor Integration, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, were the most used tests. However, in the social-emotional domain, direct assessment methods, such as interview and observation, were more frequently used and rated as more important than standardized measures. These results, and the limitations of the study, are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Stinnett","given":"Terry A."},{"family":"Havey","given":"J.

However, because the distributions of the scores in these 2 groups most often overlap, any cut point that is chosen will result in 2 types of errors: false negatives (that is, abnormal cases judged to be normal) and false positives (that is, normal cases placed in the abnormal group). Changing the cut point will alter the numbers of erroneous judgments but will not eliminate the problem. A technique called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves allows us to determine the ability of a test to discriminate between groups, to choose the optimal cut point, and to compare the performance of 2 or more tests. We discuss how to calculate and compare ROC curves and the factors that must be considered in choosing an optimal cut point.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Streiner","given":"David L"},{"family":"Cairney","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"streinerWhatROCIntroduction2007","container-title":"The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Can J Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1177/070674370705200210","ISSN":"0706-7437, 1497-0015","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,2]]},"language":"en","page":"121-128","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What's under the ROC?

  {"id":"suggateInfancyAdolescenceLongitudinal2018","abstract":"Previous research suggests that (a) individual differences in reading and language development are stable across childhood, (b) reading and vocabulary are intertwined, and (c) children’s oral narrative skill contributes to later reading comprehension. Each of these three phenomena is assessed using a longitudinal design spanning 15 years, from when children were 19 months old until they were 16 years old. Alongside measures for maternal vocabulary, a host of language and (early) reading measures, including vocabulary, early literacy development, oral narrative skill, and reading comprehension, were administered across eight time points to a sample of 58 children. Specific early language and reading skills were generally strongly correlated over time. Reading comprehension at age 12 was predicted by vocabulary at 19 months and emergent literacy at school entry. Vocabulary at 19 months of age predicted early literacy skills prior to school entry and reading comprehension at age 12 years, as did school entry literacy skills. Controlling for maternal and infant vocabulary, children’s oral narrative skill around school entry related uniquely to reading comprehension 10 years later. Findings provide new evidence for the long-term interplay between early language, literacy, and later reading and vocabulary development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Suggate","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Schaughency","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"McAnally","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Reese","given":"Elaine"}],"citation-key":"suggateInfancyAdolescenceLongitudinal2018","container-title":"Cognitive Development","container-title-short":"Cognitive Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.cogdev.2018.04.005","ISSN":"0885-2014","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"82-95","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"From infancy to adolescence: The longitudinal links between vocabulary, early literacy skills, oral narrative, and reading comprehension","title-short":"From infancy to adolescence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088520141730237X","volume":"47"},

A total of 71 intervention-control groups were selected ( N = 8,161 at posttest) from studies reporting posttest and follow-up data ( M = 11.17 months) for previously established reading interventions. The posttest effect sizes indicated effects ( dw = 0.37) that decreased to follow-up ( dw = 0.22). Overall, comprehension and phonemic awareness interventions showed good maintenance of effect that transferred to nontargeted skills, whereas phonics and fluency interventions, and those for preschool and kindergarten children, tended not to. Several methodological features also related to effect sizes at follow-up, namely experimental design and dosage, and sample attrition, risk status, and gender balance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Suggate","given":"Sebastian P."}],"citation-key":"suggateMetaanalysisLongtermEffects2016","container-title":"Journal of Learning Disabilities","container-title-short":"J Learn Disabil","DOI":"10.1177/0022219414528540","ISSN":"0022-2194, 1538-4780","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1]]},"language":"en","page":"77-96","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A meta-analysis of the long-term effects of phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and reading comprehension interventions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022219414528540","volume":"49"},

Experiment 1 examined the relationship between strategy knowledge (stability of strategy choices) and WM performance as a function of initial, gain (cued), and maintenance conditions. WM performance was significantly improved for both groups under cued conditions; however, the performances of children with RD were inferior to those of children without RD across all memory conditions. Measures of WM capacity rather than strategy stability or processing efficiency best predicted reading comprehension performance. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of strategy training on WM performance by randomly assigning children to strategy instruction or control conditions. Significant improvements in WM performance occurred as a function of training conditions, but the residual WM differences between the reading groups remained. Although the results showed that stable strategy choices, cued performance, and strategy instruction significantly bolstered WM performance in children with RD, their overall WM performance, however, was constrained by capacity limitations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Swanson","given":"H.

However, every real-world implementation of such an algorithm must address numerous problems that have little to do with the actual algorithm, like handling input and output formats, formatting node texts, and styling nodes and edges. We present a new framework, implemented in the Lua programming language and integrated into the TikZ graphics description language, that aims at simplifying the implementation of graph drawing algorithms. Implementers using the framework can focus on the core algorithmic ideas and will automatically profit from the framework’s pre- and post-processing steps as well as from the extensive capabilities of the TikZ graphics language and the \\TeX\\TeX{\\hbox{\\TeX}} typesetting engine. Algorithms already implemented using the framework include the Reingold-Tilford tree drawing algorithm, a modular version of Sugiyama’s layered algorithm, and several force-based multilevel algorithms.","author":[{"family":"Tantau","given":"Till"}],"citation-key":"tantauGraphDrawingTikZ2013","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Graph Drawing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-36763-2_46","editor":[{"family":"Didimo","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Patrignani","given":"Maurizio"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-642-36763-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"517-528","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"Graph drawing in TikZ","type":"paper-conference"},

Traditionally, these summary statistics comprise the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the ratings, and the number of observations. Such summary statistics can preserve the rank order of items, but provide distorted estimates of the relative distances between items because of the ordinal nature of Likert ratings. Inter-item relations in such ordinal scales can be more appropriately modelled by cumulative link mixed effects models (CLMMs). In a series of simulations, and with a reanalysis of an existing rating norms dataset, we show that CLMMs can be used to more accurately norm items, and can provide summary statistics analogous to the traditionally reported means and SDs, but which are disentangled from participants’ response biases.

Studies that fail to demonstrate experimental control may not be published because researchers are unwilling to submit these papers for publication and journals are unlikely to publish negative results (i.e., the file drawer effect). SCRD studies comprise a large proportion of intervention research in special education. Consequently, the existing body of research, comprised mainly of studies that show experimental control, may artificially inflate efficacy of interventions. We discuss how experimental control evolved as the standard for high-quality SCRD; why, in the era of evidence-based practice, rigorous studies that fail to fully demonstrate experimental control are important to include in the body of published intervention research; the role of non-replication studies in discovering intervention boundaries; and considerations for researchers who wish to conduct and appraise studies that fail to yield full experimental control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tincani","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."}],"citation-key":"tincaniPublishingSinglecaseResearch2018","container-title":"Remedial and Special Education","container-title-short":"Remedial and Special Education","DOI":"10.1177/0741932517697447","ISSN":"0741-9325, 1538-4756","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3]]},"language":"en","page":"118-128","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Publishing single-case research design studies that do not demonstrate experimental control","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0741932517697447","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"tincaniRaceCultureAutism2009","abstract":"The reported prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased dramatically since the 1980s. In response, researchers, educators, and policy makers have sought to develop effective technologies for assessment and intervention. A focus on evidenced-based practices is logical, given significant deficits in language, social interaction, cognition, and adaptive behavior that comprise these conditions. Although critical, a technology of best practices is insufficient without understanding the important role that diversity plays in helping persons with ASD, particularly those with the most severe impairments, to lead fulfilling lives. The aim of the current article is threefold. First, we explore the concept of diversity with particular attention to neurodiversity among persons with ASD. We describe how cultural and linguistic diversity influence identification of students with ASD in special education, with data to suggest that racially diverse students are underrepresented in the autism category. We then examine the educational process with particular focus on the impact of parent and family culture on perception of disability, the influence of diverse family systems on interventions, and the successful interventions for diverse contexts. We conclude with recommendations for culturally competent practice and research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tincani","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Boutot","given":"Amanda"}],"citation-key":"tincaniRaceCultureAutism2009","container-title":"Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities","container-title-short":"Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities","DOI":"10.2511/rpsd.34.3-4.81","ISSN":"1540-7969, 2169-2408","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9]]},"language":"en","page":"81-90","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Race, culture, and autism spectrum disorder: Understanding the role of diversity in successful educational interventions","title-short":"Race, culture, and autism spectrum disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2511/rpsd.34.3-4.81","volume":"34"},

A revised modified parallel analysis was used to determine the dimensionality of these items at each grade level. A confirmatory factor analysis was also performed on the subtest scores to evaluate alternate models of dimensionality.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The revised modified parallel analysis revealed a single dimension across items with evidence of either test specific or language area specific minor dimensions at different ages. The confirmatory factor analysis tested models involving modality (receptive or expressive) and domain (vocabulary or sentence use) against a single-dimension model. The 2-dimensional model involving domains of vocabulary and sentence use fit the data better than the single-dimensional model; however, the single-dimension model also fit the data well in the lower grades.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Much of the variance in standardized measures of language appears to be attributable to a single common factor or trait. There is a developmental trend during middle childhood for grammatical abilities and vocabulary abilities to become differentiated. These measures do not provide differential information concerning receptive and expressive abilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Tomblin","given":"J.

People with significant disabilities are not excluded from this principle, but often may be prevented from receiving high-quality and comprehensive instruction necessary for a healthy sexual life. The functional model of self-determination emphasizes increasing knowledge, access to environments, and positive self-perceptions and may be an effective framework for the delivery of sexuality education to people with significant disabilities. We explored ways in which self-determination and sexuality education for people with significant disabilities are aligned. We also conducted a systematic review of sexuality education intervention research for this population and found significant gaps related to self-determined sexuality.

Data were compared to determine the effects on alphabetic skills acquisition and maintenance. The effects on student attentive behavior and engagement in problem behavior in each intervention condition also were compared. Results indicated that both interventions were effective for improving and maintaining student alphabet recognition skills.

Unproven and ineffective interventions emerge and are adopted for various reasons. Ineffective interventions are inevitably harmful and require professionals to adopt a conservative approach that both minimizes potential for harm and maximizes potential for educational benefit. This is fundamental to the evidence-based movement, but special education professionals may not recognize and avoid ineffective interventions. This article aims to improve recognition of potentially ineffective interventions by shedding light on aspects of science, pseudoscience, and some mistakes frequently made in evaluating claims of intervention effectiveness. By becoming familiar with the distinctions between science and pseudoscience, and by developing an understanding of how errors in thinking are used to promote and defend interventions unsupported by empirical evidence, special education professionals can better protect their students with disabilities from potential harms associated with ineffective practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."}],"citation-key":"traversEvaluatingClaimsAvoid2017","container-title":"Intervention in School and Clinic","container-title-short":"Intervention in School and Clinic","DOI":"10.1177/1053451216659466","ISSN":"1053-4512, 1538-4810","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"language":"en","page":"195-203","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evaluating claims to avoid pseudoscientific and unproven practices in special education","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1053451216659466","volume":"52"},

Strategic marketing, confirmation bias, pseudoscience, anti-science, and fallacy explain this troubling renewal.

  {"id":"traversRacialDisparityAdministrative2014","abstract":"Evidence of disparate identification of autism at national and local levels is accumulating, but there is little understanding about disparate identification of autism at the state level. This study examined trends in state-level administrative identification of autism under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Prevalence rates and odds ratios were calculated for each state using enrollment counts for years 2000 and 2007. Results indicated increases in administrative prevalence of autism for all racial groups from 2000 to 2007, but increasing underidentification of Black and Hispanic students in 2007 compared with White students. Variability existed in the identification of autism among Black and Hispanic students across states over time. Implications for the findings are discussed in the context of the field’s need to establish rigorous policies and practices for eligibility determinations due to autism and equitable access to evidence-based intervention practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Krezmien","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Mulcahy","given":"Candace"},{"family":"Tincani","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"traversRacialDisparityAdministrative2014","container-title":"The Journal of Special Education","container-title-short":"J Spec Educ","DOI":"10.1177/0022466912454014","ISSN":"0022-4669, 1538-4764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11]]},"language":"en","page":"155-166","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Racial disparity in administrative autism identification across the united states during 2000 and 2007","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022466912454014","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"traversReplicationResearchSpecial2016","abstract":"Replicating previously reported empirical research is a necessary aspect of an evidence-based field of special education, but little formal investigation into the prevalence of replication research in the special education research literature has been conducted. Various factors may explain the lack of attention to replication of special education intervention research, including emphasis on quantity of publications, esteem for novel findings, and barriers to publishing high-quality studies with null or negative effects. This article introduces the special issue on replication of special education intervention research by first providing an overview of concepts and issues related to replication. Specific attention is then given to replication as it relates to group design and single case experimental design research, two prominent albeit philosophically different empirical methodologies. We then briefly describe how replications using these research designs can be conducted in complementary ways to better understand intervention effects and advance evidence-based practices in special education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Bryan G."},{"family":"Therrien","given":"William J."},{"family":"Coyne","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"traversReplicationResearchSpecial2016","container-title":"Remedial and Special Education","container-title-short":"Remedial and Special Education","DOI":"10.1177/0741932516648462","ISSN":"0741-9325, 1538-4756","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7]]},"language":"en","page":"195-204","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Replication research and special education","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0741932516648462","volume":"37"},

While the topic of sexuality has received increased attention in the fields of intellectual and developmental disabilities generally, less consideration has focused on the unique needs of individuals with ASD specifically. This paper presents one position in support of sexuality education for children and adolescents with ASD. The nature of human sexuality is discussed to provide a context for the rights of individuals with ASD to learn about their sexuality. Further justification for providing sexuality education in terms of the unique characteristics of this population is offered in conjunction with potential consequences of failing to provide sexuality education. Lastly, information regarding a decision-making process for sexuality education curriculum is presented, including the responsibilities of families and professionals providing sexuality education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Travers","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Tincani","given":"Matt"}],"citation-key":"traversSexualityEducationIndividuals2010","container-title":"Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities","ISSN":"2154-1647","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"284-293","publisher":"Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities","source":"JSTOR","title":"Sexuality education for individuals with autism spectrum disorders: Critical issues and decision making guidelines","title-short":"Sexuality education for individuals with autism spectrum disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23879812","volume":"45"},

Using data ( N = 8,813; ages 17—97 years) aggregated across 38 separate studies, MDS was applied to 16 cognitive variables representative of five well-established cognitive abilities. Parallel to confirmatory factor analytic solutions, and consistent with past MDS applications, the results for young (18—39 years), middle (40—65 years), and old (66—97 years) adult age groups consistently revealed a two-dimensional radex disk, with variables from fluid reasoning tests located at the center. Using a new method, target measures hypothesized to reflect three aspects of cognitive control ( updating, storage-plus-processing, and executive functioning) were projected onto the radex disk. Parallel to factor analytic results, these variables were also found to be centrally located in the cognitive ability space. The advantages and limitations of the radex representation are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tucker-Drob","given":"Elliot M."},{"family":"Salthouse","given":"Timothy A."}],"citation-key":"tucker-drobMethodsMeasuresConfirmatory2009","container-title":"International Journal of Behavioral Development","container-title-short":"International Journal of Behavioral Development","DOI":"10.1177/0165025409104489","ISSN":"0165-0254, 1464-0651","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5]]},"language":"en","page":"277-285","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Methods and measures: Confirmatory factor analysis and multidimensional scaling for construct validation of cognitive abilities","title-short":"Methods and measures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0165025409104489","volume":"33"},

There is no consensus on the definition of intelligence, not even within specific fields that study intelligence, such as psychometrics.

In our view, it is important to have a clear conception of what intelligence is. In this chapter we adhere to such a conception and present a formal model of psychometric intelligence.

Controversies arise as to whether such models are adequate conceptualizations of WM in children. The aim of the present study is to perform a systematic review of studies that evaluate the structure of WM during childhood. Databases (PubMed, Scopus) and article reference lists were reviewed, identifying 264 studies and including 14 in the review. These include participants between 4 and 15 years of age, with typical development, and they evaluated the structure of WM using confirmatory factor analysis. Results show that from 4 to 6 years onwards a structure composed of a domain-general executive component together with two domain-specific storage components (verbal, visuospatial) is identified, generally being the best fitting model. Limitations and potential contributions of the reported results are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vernucci","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Canet-Juric","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Zamora","given":"Eliana V."},{"family":"Richard’s","given":"María M."}],"citation-key":"vernucciStructureWorkingMemory2021","container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/20445911.2021.1887199","ISSN":"2044-5911","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,14]]},"note":"ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0] \n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/20445911.2021.1887199","page":"1-16","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The structure of working memory during childhood: A systematic review","title-short":"The structure of working memory during childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20445911.2021.1887199","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"vonbastianAdvancingUnderstandingIndividual2020","abstract":"Attentional control as an ability to regulate information processing during goal-directed behavior is critical to many theories of human cognition and thought to predict a large range of everyday behaviors. However, in recent years, failures to reliably assess individual differences in attentional control have sparked a debate concerning whether attentional control, as currently conceptualized and assessed, can be regarded as a valid psychometric construct. In this consensus paper, we summarize the current debate from theoretical, methodological, and analytical perspectives. First, we propose a consensus-based definition of attentional control and the cognitive mechanisms that potentially contribute to individual differences in attentional control. Next, guided by the findings of an in-depth literature survey, we discuss the psychometric considerations that are critical when assessing attentional control. We then provide suggestions for recent methodological and analytical approaches that can alleviate the most common concerns. We conclude that, to truly advance our understanding of the construct of attentional control, we must develop a theory-driven and empirically supported consensus on how we define, operationalize, and assess attentional control. This consensus paper presents a first step to achieve this goal; a shift toward transparent reporting, sharing of materials and data, and cross-laboratory efforts will further accelerate progress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bastian","given":"Claudia Christina","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Blais","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Brewer","given":"Gene Arnold"},{"family":"Gyurkovics","given":"Mate"},{"family":"Hedge","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Kałamała","given":"Patrycja"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Matt Ethan"},{"family":"Oberauer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Rey-Mermet","given":"Alodie"},{"family":"Rouder","given":"Jeffrey N."},{"family":"Souza","given":"Alessandra S."},{"family":"Bartsch","given":"Lea Maria"},{"family":"Conway","given":"Andrew R.

The study also tested the extent executive functioning, verbal working memory, and mental rotation spatial ability predict mathematics achievement. Structural equation modeling was deployed to test the model. The model was derived from prior studies that tested the relationships among subsets of the variables tested in this study. The structural equation model showed a good model fit. Executive functioning significantly predicted both verbal working memory and visuospatial working memory, though the predictive relationship was stronger from executive functioning to visuospatial working memory. These findings are consistent with prior findings and existing theory pertaining to the structure of working memory and the intercorrelations among sub-components of working memory. Finally, the path loading from mental rotation to mathematics achievement was statistically significant and moderate in magnitude, confirming the important implications of mental rotation spatial ability to mathematics achievement.

  {"id":"watrinStructuralInvarianceDeclarative2022","abstract":"The differentiation–dedifferentiation hypothesis of general cognitive ability has been widely studied, but comparable research on crystallized intelligence is scarce. To close this gap, we conducted an empirical test of the age differentiation hypothesis of declarative knowledge as proposed in Cattell’s investment theory, which predicts that knowledge differentiates into diverse forms after compulsory education ends. Thereto, a cross-sectional sample of 1,629 participants aged 18–70 years (M = 45.3) completed a comprehensive knowledge test comprising 120 broadly sampled questions from 12 knowledge domains, as well as a measure of openness/intellect. To investigate age-related differences in the level and structure of knowledge, we performed invariance tests in local structural equation models. The results did not provide any evidence for age-related differentiation of declarative knowledge but indicated age-related differences in the mean structure. Higher levels in openness/intellect were associated with higher levels in knowledge but not with more differentiated structure of knowledge. Contrary to predictions of the investment theory, our results suggest that declarative knowledge is age invariant across major parts of the adult lifespan.

  {"id":"wattsRiskierTestsValidity2019","abstract":"We advanced several “riskier tests” of the validity of bifactor models of psychopathology, which included that the general and specific psychopathology factors should be reliable and well represented by their respective indicators and that including a general factor should improve on the correlated factor model’s external validity. We compared bifactor and correlated factors models of psychopathology using data from a community sample of youth ( N = 2,498) whose parents provided ratings on psychopathology and theoretically relevant external criteria (i.e., personality, aggression, antisociality). Bifactor models tended to yield either general or specific factors that were unstable and difficult to interpret. The general factor appeared to reflect a differentially weighted amalgam of psychopathology rather than a liability for psychopathology broadly construed. With rare exceptions, bifactor models did not explain additional variance in first-order psychopathology symptom dimensions or external criteria compared with correlated factors models. Together, our findings call into question the validity of bifactor models of psychopathology and the p factor more broadly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Ashley L."},{"family":"Poore","given":"Holly E."},{"family":"Waldman","given":"Irwin D."}],"citation-key":"wattsRiskierTestsValidity2019","container-title":"Clinical Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Clinical Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1177/2167702619855035","ISSN":"2167-7026, 2167-7034","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]},"language":"en","page":"1285-1303","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Riskier tests of the validity of the bifactor model of psychopathology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702619855035","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"weissFlexibilityMoreFluency2022","abstract":"Flexibility (i.e., the number of categorically different ideas), fluency (i.e., the answer quantity), and originality (i.e., the quality of ideas) are essential aspects of the ability to think divergently. Theoretically, fluency and ideational flexibility tasks are akin to one another. However, flexibility was also considered to be uniquely related to working memory capacity due to the task requirements involved in generating diverse answers (e.g., self-monitoring, suppression, and category generation). Given that the role of working memory is strengthened in flexibility tasks relative to fluency and originality tasks, flexibility should be more strongly related with working memory. Additionally, mental speed should show a similar pattern of results because mental speed has been previously related to task complexity. Based on a sample of N = 409 adults (Mage = 24.01 years), we found in latent variable models that fluency/originality strongly predicts flexibility and accounts for 61% of its variance. Creative flexibility was unrelated to working memory and mental speed after controlling for fluency/originality. Additionally, the residual of a latent flexibility factor was unrelated to self-reported creative activities. We concluded that flexibility, as measured here, can be deemed primarily a method factor that did not show value over and above fluency/originality as assessed in traditional fluency and originality tasks. We discussed perspectives for disentangling trait and method variance in flexibility tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"Selina"},{"family":"Wilhelm","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"weissFlexibilityMoreFluency2022","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"weissReappraisalThresholdHypothesis2020","abstract":"Intelligence has been declared as a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity, which was subsequently (erroneously) translated into the so-called threshold hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts a change in the correlation between creativity and intelligence at around 1.33 standard deviations above the population mean. A closer inspection of previous inconclusive results suggests that the heterogeneity is mostly due to the use of suboptimal data analytical procedures. Herein, we applied and compared three methods that allowed us to handle intelligence as a continuous variable. In more detail, we examined the threshold of the creativity-intelligence relation with (a) scatterplots and heteroscedasticity analysis, (b) segmented regression analysis, and (c) local structural equation models in two multivariate studies (N1 = 456; N2 = 438). We found no evidence for the threshold hypothesis of creativity across different analytical procedures in both studies. Given the problematic history of the threshold hypothesis and its unequivocal rejection with appropriate multivariate methods, we recommend the total abandonment of the threshold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"Selina"},{"family":"Steger","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Schroeders","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Wilhelm","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"weissReappraisalThresholdHypothesis2020","container-title":"Journal of Intelligence","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"widamanThinkingThriceSum2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Measurement is fundamental to all research in psychology and should be accorded greater scrutiny than typically occurs. Among other claims, McNeish and Wolf (Thinking twice about sum scores.\n              Behavior Research Methods\n              ,\n              52\n              , 2287-2305) argued that use of sum scores (a) implies that a highly constrained latent variable model underlies items comprising a scale, and (b) may misrepresent or bias relations with other criteria. The central claim by McNeish and Wolf that use of sum scores requires the assumption that a parallel test model underlies item responses is incorrect and without psychometric merit. Instead, if a set of items is unidimensional, estimators of reliability are available even if the factor model underlying the set of items does not have a highly constrained form. Thus, dimensionality of a set of items is the key issue, and whether strict constraints on parameter estimates do or do not hold dictate the appropriate way to estimate reliability. McNeish and Wolf also claimed that more precise forms of scoring, such as estimating factor scores, would be preferable to sum scores. We provide analytic bases for reliability estimation and then provide several demonstrations of reliability estimation and the relative advantages of sum scores and factor scores. We contend that several claims by McNeish and Wolf are questionable and that, as a result, multiple recommendations they made and conclusions they drew are incorrect. The upshot is that, once the dimensional structure of a set of items is verified, sum scores often have a solid psychometric basis and therefore are frequently quite adequate for psychological research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Widaman","given":"Keith F."},{"family":"Revelle","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"widamanThinkingThriceSum2022","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-022-01849-w","ISSN":"1554-3528","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,25]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Thinking thrice about sum scores, and then some more about measurement and analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13428-022-01849-w"},

  {"id":"wilsonNeurocognitivePredictorsResponse2021","abstract":"This study explores the neurocognitive predictors of response to intervention with GraphoGame Rime (GG Rime), an adaptive software game designed to aid the learning of English phonics. A cohort of 398 children (aged 6–7 years) who had participated in a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) of GG Rime in the United Kingdom were studied. Half were randomly assigned to play GG Rime and the other half were assigned to Business As Usual (BAU). A series of pretests were given prior to the intervention to all participants, designed to measure phonological awareness skills, executive function (EF) skills and the ability to synchronise finger tapping to a rhythmic beat. Rhythmic synchronisation has been linked to reading readiness and early reading attainment, and is related to phonological awareness. Individual differences prior to the intervention in all three types of measure were significantly associated with progression through the game. Gender was also important for progression through the game, with boys progressing significantly further than girls. Vocabulary was not a predictor of progression through the game. Playing time, rhythmic synchronisation, phonological skills and EF skills did not differ by gender. Once playing time and non-verbal cognitive ability were controlled, phonological awareness, EF, rhythmic synchronisation and gender all remained significant predictors of progression through the game. In further analyses comparing these predictors, their interactions and controlling for the autoregressor of prior responsiveness to phonics instruction, phoneme awareness and EF skills were the strongest unique predictors. Analyses with the whole cohort (analysing BAU and GG children independently) showed that all neurocognitive measures contributed to progress in reading and spelling over the school year. We conclude that individual differences in phonological skills and EF skills predict which children will benefit most from computer assisted reading interventions like GG Rime. Further, boys respond better to this computerised intervention than girls. Accordingly, to be maximally beneficial to poor readers, the supplementary use of GG Rime in addition to ongoing classroom literacy instruction could be especially targeted to boys, but should be accompanied by a focus on developing both oral phonological awareness and EF skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Henna"},{"family":"Mead","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Ulla"},{"family":"Wolpert","given":"Mary A."},{"family":"Goswami","given":"Usha"}],"citation-key":"wilsonNeurocognitivePredictorsResponse2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Education","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"woodcockFunctionalCattellHornCarrollNomenclature2018","abstract":"This chapter reviews the evolution of Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory, in an effort to examine the state of the state of the art in this dominant theory defining the structure of cognitive abilities. It suggests a more practical reconceptualization of CHC theory and functional nomenclature to describe CHC latent cognitive factors. The nomenclature associated with CHC theory has become more complex as scholars have elaborated upon the theory, introducing their additions and revisions to the taxonomy. In the late 1990s, Kevin McGrew negotiated the merger of Carroll's three-stratum theory with Cattell and Horn's fluid-crystallized model theory; he was thus instrumental in the ascendancy of the consolidated CHC model in the field of cognitive assessment. Philip Vernon's model was an important reconciliation of Charles Spearman's two-factor model and L. L. Thurstone's primary abilities. For any revision or refinement of the model to be considered valid, it too must be subjected to rigorous research, with each suggested addition, subtraction, or substitution carefully weighed and considered.","author":[{"family":"Woodcock","given":"Richard W."},{"family":"Maricle","given":"Denise E."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"McGill","given":"Ryan J."}],"citation-key":"woodcockFunctionalCattellHornCarrollNomenclature2018","container-title":"Contemporary intellectual assessment: Theories, tests, and issues","edition":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"901--911","publisher":"Guilford Press","title":"Functional Cattell-Horn-Carroll nomenclature for practical applications","type":"chapter"},

This study extended Keith’s (1999) examination of bias across racial/ethnic groups for general and specific cognitive abilities predicting reading achievement. It employed a higher-order model of cognitive abilities based on Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory and a three-factor reading achievement model adapted from Niileksela et al. (2016). Using samples of 9- to 13-year-old Black, Hispanic, and White children from the WJ IV norming sample, models representing CHC cognitive abilities and reading demonstrated invariance across groups. Despite the fact that the models where CHC broad abilities predicted reading achievement were a poor fit, results indicated similar predictive relations for Black children as for other racial/ethnic groups.

The white paper presents a purported consensus of experts that an approach combining response to intervention with severe discrepancy is consistent with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The analysis examines the white paper position in relation to the IDEA legislation, regulations, and agency policy interpretations. The conclusions are that this position is legally flawed in terms of its reliance on the “pattern of strengths and weaknesses” provision, its failure to consider state special education laws, and its overemphasis on the processing component. As a result, the position is justifiable only as advocating revisions, rather than in finding support, in the law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zirkel","given":"Perry A."}],"citation-key":"zirkelHalePositionThird2013","container-title":"Learning Disability Quarterly","container-title-short":"Learning Disability Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0731948713477850","ISSN":"0731-9487","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"93-96","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Hale position for a “third method” for specific learning disabilities identification: A legal analysis","title-short":"The hale position for a “third method” for specific learning disabilities identification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0731948713477850","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"zoccolottiNetworkAnalysisRelationship2021","abstract":"Background. Skill learning (e.g., reading, spelling and maths) has been predominantly treated separately in the neuropsychological literature. However, skills (as well as their corresponding deficits), tend to partially overlap. We recently proposed a multi-level model of learning skills (based on the distinction among competence, performance, and acquisition) as a framework to provide a unitary account of these learning skills. In the present study, we examined the performance of an unselected group of third- to fifth-grade children on standard reading, spelling, and maths tasks, and tested the relationships among these skills with a network analysis, i.e., a method particularly suited to analysing relations among different domains. Methods. We administered a battery of reading, spelling, and maths tests to 185 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children (103 M, 82 F). Results. The network analysis indicated that the different measures of the same ability (i.e., reading, spelling, and maths) formed separate clusters, in keeping with the idea that they are based on different competences. However, these clusters were also related to each other, so that three nodes were more central in connecting them. In keeping with the multi-level model of learning skills, two of these tests (arithmetic facts subtest and spelling words with ambiguous transcription) relied heavily on the ability to recall specific instances, a factor hypothesised to underlie the co-variation among learning skills. Conclusions. The network analysis indicated both elements of association and of partial independence among learning skills. Interestingly, the study was based on standard clinical instruments, indicating that the multi-level model of learning skills might provide a framework for the clinical analysis of these learning skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zoccolotti","given":"Pierluigi"},{"family":"Angelelli","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Marinelli","given":"Chiara Valeria"},{"family":"Romano","given":"Daniele Luigi"}],"citation-key":"zoccolottiNetworkAnalysisRelationship2021","container-title":"Brain Sciences","container-title-short":"Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/brainsci11050656","ISSN":"2076-3425","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,18]]},"language":"en","page":"656","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A network analysis of the relationship among reading, spelling and maths skills","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/5/656","volume":"11"}
