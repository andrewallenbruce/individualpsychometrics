In everyday language, people use *probability* and *odds* interchangeably. Technically, they are related, but not at all the same thing.\n\nWhen the odds of winning are 3 to 1, there will be 3 wins for every loss.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-margin .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin fig-margin='true' fig.cap.location='top'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The relationship between probability and odds.

Odds have a minimum of 0 but have no upper bound (See @fig-p2oddsfigure). \n\nIn many statistical applications, we need to convert a probability to a value that has neither upper nor lower bounds. A [logit]{.defword}[A **logit** is a portmanteau of *log unit*. In item-response theory, ability and item difficulty are expressed in terms of logits. Logits are sometimes called the *log-odds* because they are calculated as the (natural) log of the odds: $\\\\text{logit}(p)=\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{1-p}\\\\right)$]{.defword .column-margin} maps probabilities onto real numbers from negative to positive infinity (See @fig-p2logits).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-margin .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin fig-margin='true' fig.cap.location='top'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The relationship between probability and logits.

The most prominent in psychological assessment is the $W$-score (AKA Growth Score Values), developed by @woodcockCommonScaleMeasurement1971. An accessible discussion of its derivation can by found in @bensonScoresBackgroundDerivation2018.\n\nIf ability $\\theta$ is in logits, then $W$ is calculated like so:\n\n$$\nW = \\frac{20}{\\ln(9)}\\theta+500\n$$\n\nAlthough the coefficient $\\frac{20}{\\ln(9)}$ may seem strange, it has some desirable features. It is equivalent to 20 times the base-9 logarithm of $e$:\n\n$$\n20 \\log_9(e) = \\frac{20}{\\ln(9)} \\approx 9.1024\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-margin .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin fig-margin='true' fig.cap.location='top'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The relationship between ability-difficulty differences and probability of answering correctly.

This feature allows us to make predictions about how like a person with a particular ability level will correctly answer an item of a particular difficulty.\n\n\n\nThe [Relative Proficiency Index (RPI)]{.defword}[The **Relative Proficiency Index (RPI)** tells us the proability a person with of ability $\\\\theta$ will answer an item correctly given that a person with ability $\\\\mu_\\\\theta$ has probability $p$ of answering it correctly.]{.defword .column-margin} was first used in the *Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests* [@woodcockWoodcockReadingMastery1973]. The RPI answers the following question:\n\n\n> When the average same-age peer with ability $\\mu_\\theta$ has probability $p$ of answering an item, what is the probability of answering correctly for a person of ability $\\theta$?\n\n\nThe RPI can be calculated like so:\n\n$$\nRPI = \\left(1+e^{-\\left(\\theta-\\mu_{\\theta}+\\text{logit}(p)\\right)}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\theta &= \\text{Ability level of person (in logits)}\\\\\n  \\mu_{\\theta} &= \\text{Average ability level (in logits) of a reference group}\\\\\n  p &= \\text{Probability a person with ability } \\mu_\\theta \\text{ will answer correctly}\\\\\n  \\text{logit}(p) &= \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = p \\text{ converted to logits}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe psycheval package can calculate the RPI using the the `rpi` function. By default, the primary inputs `x` and `mu` are assumed to be on the W scale, and the criterion $p$ is .90.\n\nSuppose a person's ability corresponds to a W-score of 460 and same-age peers have an average W score of 500:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(psycheval)\nrpi(x = 460, mu = 500)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n0.1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis difference of 40 W score points means that when typical same-age peers have a 90% chance of answering an item correctly (a common benchmark for mastery), this person has a 10% chance of answering the item correctly.\n\nIf `x` and `mu` are logits, then you can specify `scale = 1` like so:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrpi(x = 1, mu = 0, scale = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n0.9607297\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe RPI works nicely for documenting deficits, but for gifted students, the RPI is quite high, often near 1. In such cases, we can also calculate the probability a person with ability $\\mu_\\theta$ can answer an item that a person with ability $\\theta$ has a probability $p_\\theta$ of answering correctly:\n\n$$\nRPI_{\\text{reversed}} = \\left(1+e^{-\\left(\\mu_\\theta-\\theta+\\text{logit}(p_\\theta)\\right)}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nSuppose a person has a W score of 550, which is 50 points higher than typical same-age peers.

Unfortunately, this fact does not convey the degree of giftedness in an evocative manner.\n\nTo get a better sense of how far advanced this person is compared to the performance of typical same-age peers, we can reverse the RPI like so.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrpi(x = 550, mu = 500, reverse = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n0.03571429\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis means that when this person has a .9 probability of answering an item correctly, the typical same-age peer has about a .036 probability of answering it. Thus, this person is capable of completing tasks that are quite difficult for typical same-age peers.\n\nThe standard RPI refers to a proficiency level of .9, but the `rpi` function can calculate the relative proficiency index at any criterion level. For example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrpi(x = 550, mu = 500, criterion = .10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n0.9642857\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis means that when a typical same-age peer has a .10 probability of answering an item correctly, this person will answer it correctly with a .96 probability.\n\nAn Excel spreadsheet that calculates this \"generalized\" RPI can be found [here](https://github.com/wjschne/accessingpsyche_resources/raw/main/Generalized%20Relative%20Proficiency%20Index.xlsx).\n\n## Thresholds\n\nThe traditional threshold for diagnosing intellectual disability is 70. If a person's observed IQ $\\left(r_{XX}=.97\\right)$ is 68, what is the probability that the person's true score is 70 or less? \n\nMore generally, given an observed score $X$ with reliability coefficient $r_{XX}$, what is the probability that the associated true score $T$ is less than or equal to threshold $\\tau$?\n\nWhen we predict the true score $T$ with a specific value of $X$, the estimated true score $\\hat{T}$ is:\n\n\n$$\\hat{T}=r_{XX}\\left(X-\\mu_X\\right)+\\mu_X$$\n\nThe standard error of the estimate $\\sigma_{T-\\hat{T}}$ in this prediction is:\n\n$$\\sigma_{T-\\hat{T}}=\\sigma_X\\sqrt{r_{XX}-r_{XX}^2}$$\n\nIf we have reason to assume that the prediction errors are normally distributed, the probability that the true score $T$ is less than or equal to threshold $\\tau$ can be calculated using the standard normal cumulative distribution function $\\Phi$ like so:\n\n$$P(T\\le\\tau)=\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\tau-\\hat{T}}{\\sigma_{T-\\hat{T}}}\\right)$$\n\nUsing this formula, we can see that our hypothetical person with IQ = 68, the probability that the true score is 70 or lower is about .66. @fig-thresholdprobability shows the probabilities for all values near the diagnostic threshold of 70.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The Probability a True Score Will Be Less Than or Equal to 70](unfinished_files/figure-html/fig-thresholdprobability-1.svg){#fig-thresholdprobability fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin .tbl-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\" button_r='true' figlabel='fig-thresholdprobability'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](unfinished_files/figure-html/thresholdprobabilityCode-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a shortcut to using the formulas displayed above\n\n\n### Multivariate Thresholds\n\nTo diagnose intellectual disability, we need a standardized measure of intellectual functioning (usually an IQ test) and well-validated measure of adaptive functioning.
